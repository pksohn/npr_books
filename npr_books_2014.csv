Roz Chast,Can't We Talk About Something More Pleasant?: A Memoir,"Who would have expected that the most profound meditation yet written on the trials of caring for aging parents would arrive in the form of a graphic book? Chast's memoir is a masterpiece, describing the exhaustion and absurdity, the anger and heartbreak of this cosmic Life Switcheroo that so many of us boomer-generation readers are experiencing. From the sad looniness of having to clean out her failing parents' Brooklyn apartment (whose closets are stuffed with toasters — still in their boxes! — and old bank books) to the desperate anxieties over the astronomical costs of end-of-life care, Chast captures the totality of the ""adult child of elderly parents"" experience.

David Mitchell,The Bone Clocks: A Novel,"We public radio people are generally spoiled by free books. After years of living off the ""giveaway pile"" at the office, it takes a lot for me to buy a book. But I bought David Mitchell's latest. In hardcover. And it was totally worth it. The novel, which blends realism and fantasy, traces the life of a woman who gets caught up in a war between two groups of ancient, near-immortals. I read it flying from D.C. to London, and it carried me much further than that — across centuries, continents and genres. I'm not enough of a Mitchell fan to attend his conferences or read critical essays about him; I am enough of a fan to read nearly everything he's written. And <em>The Bone Clocks</em> ranks among his best.","[npr-staff-picks, rather-long, realistic-fiction, science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing, tales-from-around-the-world]",1400065674,9781400065677
Jill Lepore,The Secret History Of Wonder Woman,"Wonder Woman has always been as divisive as she is popular. Even as millions of girls followed her adventures, Wonder Woman's progressive politics panicked conservative sorts, like the psychiatrist who testified to the Senate about the comic's terrifying vision that ""Women in these stories are placed on equal footing with men."" In her <em>Secret History,</em> Jill Lepore deftly sketches the Amazon superhero's life — her creators, the increasing influence of comics, and the social upheaval she reflects — in wry and enthusiastic prose. It's an engaging history of an iconic character and how culture has changed her (and changed around her).","[biography-and-memoir, book-club-ideas, comics-and-graphic-novels, eye-opening-reads, family-matters, lets-talk-about-sex, science-and-society]",0385354045,9780385354042
Matt Fraction and Chip Zdarsky,Sex Criminals Volume 1: One Weird Trick,"Fresh-faced robbers, lighthearted humor and celebrations of reading aren't usually found in R-rated comics — as to what <em>is</em> usually found in R-rated comics, that will have to wait for another day — but Matt Fraction and Chip Zdarsky seem determined to upend every stereotype about carnal entertainment. <em>Sex Criminals</em> bubbles over with joyous energy. Fraction provides a charming concept and brisk storyline, and Zdarsky's art is luscious and varied. There's even a cheeky tribute to <em>The Family Circus.</em> You might not want to read <em>Sex Criminals</em> in public, but do read it.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, funny-stuff, lets-talk-about-sex, love-stories, mysteries-and-thrillers]",1607069466,9781607069461
Sarah Waters,The Paying Guests,"I spent a good couple months reading <em>The Paying Guests</em> in 2014 — not because the book is long, but because I couldn't let go of the pleasure of reading it. The bare bones: Post World War I, a newly impoverished Frances Wray and her mother are forced to take in boarders, the young couple Leonard and Lilian Barber. The Barbers are several rungs down the social ladder from the Wrays, but post-war British society is changing — everything from family life to the place of women — and every relationship in the house is affected. When a romance develops between two of the characters (I won't give away which two), the plot explodes. This book reads like a Daphne Du Maurier psychological thriller with the heat turned way up. And when I say heat, I mean it. I'll never think of a scullery without blushing again.","[npr-staff-picks, book-club-ideas, family-matters, for-history-lovers, historical-fiction, lets-talk-about-sex, love-stories, rather-long, realistic-fiction]",1594633118,9781594633119
Patricia Hruby Powell and Christian Robinson,Josephine: The Dazzling Life Of Josephine Baker,"It would be nearly impossible to write a bad biography of Josephine Baker, civil rights activist and superstar. Glamorous dancer, spy, sparkplug and owner of a pet leopard named Chiquita — not even the driest prose could make these facts seem dull. But to create words and pictures that match her electric crackle — that's a challenge. Patricia Hruby Powell's vivid, rhythmic poetry and Christian Robinson's arrestingly bold acrylic paintings accomplish something special by simply doing justice to Baker's remarkable journey from segregated St. Louis to performing in Paris. Your kids will be dancing around in banana skirts after reading this one.

Rowan Jacobsen,"Apples Of Uncommon Character: Heirlooms, Modern Classics, And Little-Known Wonders","<em>Apples of Uncommon Character</em> is a who's who of apples — 123 ""portraits"" of different varieties, described and photographed in loving detail. Rowan Jacobson explains how only a handful of apples — of the thousands once available in the 19th century — ever made it to modern supermarkets. He laments the bright but tasteless Red Delicious is a ""disaster"" that American consumers brought upon themselves. Now, a renaissance is underway as heirloom apple enthusiasts race to save rare varieties before they die out. Jacobson offers resources, recipes, facts and tips to delight any apple geek — and his 300-page Facebook-of-fruit is full of creative descriptions, such as, ""Like the Incredible Hulk, Mutsu is huge, green, and strangely lovable.""","[npr-staff-picks, cookbooks-and-food, eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, its-all-geek-to-me]",1620402270,9781620402276
Chang-rae Lee,On Such A Full Sea: A Novel,"There's been a lot of traffic in dystopias recently, but when a great literary novelist takes on the genre, it's worth paying close attention. Chang-rae Lee's <em>On Such A Full Sea</em> is a desolate vision of the future, which begins in the former Baltimore, now known as B-mor. A young woman named Fan sets off in search of her vanished lover, across a highly stratified society, strange and immoral. Lee's writing is gorgeous and the literary device of a kind of Greek chorus — the community voice of B-Mor — feels fresh, but also timeless. Like most dystopias, the book is an allegory, but it never seems obvious or on-the-nose — it's more like a fable, simple and cautionary — an important critique of a world we'll hope we don't see.","[npr-staff-picks, book-club-ideas, science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side]",1594486107,9781594486104
Leslie Jamison,The Empathy Exams: Essays,"<em>The Empathy Exams</em> is a trove of treats for those who enjoy a genre I'll call ""travelisophical"": traveling to a strange world and trying to make philosophical sense of it. It has essays on imprisoned marathoners (""What happens when you confine a man whose whole life is motion?""), a contagious skin condition that's likely imagined (""Doubting Morgellons hasn't stopped me from being afraid I'll get it.""), poverty tourism and a delightful jag on sweetness called ""In Defense of Saccharin(e).""

Amanda Petrusich,"Do Not Sell At Any Price: The Wild, Obsessive Hunt For The World's Rarest 78rpm Records","The 78 rpm record is ""not a medium that invites dabbling,"" Amanda Petrusich writes. No kidding. It's hard to even find a turntable that will play the antique, 10-inch pieces of shellac, let alone lay your hands upon the discs. So when Petrusich finds herself in the Milwaukee River, hunting for 78s downstream from a demolished record pressing plant, you get a sense of both the stubbornness and the scraping desperation of the obsessive hunters of 78s she profiles in her book. Petrusich is an outsider — a young woman among (mostly) older men who admits in the book's prologue that her job as a music critic in the 21st century made collecting physical records feel like a pose. But she's an amazingly sympathetic writer with an eye for the detail that makes both her eccentric collectors and the objects they fetishize step out of caricature into idiosyncratic truth.","[npr-staff-picks, eye-opening-reads, for-music-lovers, its-all-geek-to-me, seriously-great-writing]",1451667051,9781451667059
N.K. Jemisin,The Inheritance Trilogy,"N.K. Jemisin's epic fantasy series has just been reissued in a handy omnibus edition — so there's no better time to visit the fractured, fractious Hundred Thousand Kingdoms, where the ruthless Arameri family rules from its glowing white sky palace, built by enslaved gods. So many fantasy writers fall into the one-planet-one-culture trap, but not Jemisin, who creates a fabulously diverse array of peoples and lands, shot through with magic, loss, sex and heartbreak. Best of all, this omnibus includes a brand-new novella, <em>The Awakened Kingdom,</em> set in the same world as the previous three books.","[npr-staff-picks, family-matters, rather-long, science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing]",9780316334006,9780316334006
Colson Whitehead,"The Noble Hustle: Poker, Beef Jerky, And Death","You do not have to know anything about poker or even care about it to immerse yourself in Colson Whitehead's memoir, <em>The Noble Hustle.</em> In 2011, Grantland gave him the assignment to compete in the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas, and write about it. Whitehead was a casual player, and he writes in depth about his preparation for the game and his progress, but the true delight of this book is his cool hilarity. It's not really a spoiler to say that Whitehead doesn't get rich — but neither is this a book about learning life through poker. It's more like being inside a particularly interesting brain experiencing a specific and odd thing. I'd read a book by Whitehead about car repair — his turn of phrase is so delicious that you'll have to restrain yourself from interrupting whoever's nearby to read them great line after great line.","[npr-staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, eye-opening-reads, funny-stuff, its-all-geek-to-me, science-and-society, seriously-great-writing]",0385537050,9780385537056
Gary Shteyngart,Little Failure: A Memoir,"Gary Shteyngart is a memoirist not out for revenge but for truth, and his quest takes him to various interesting places in this lively and forthcoming book. An only child who immigrated to Queens from Leningrad with his parents in 1979, he not only gives the reader an intimate look at his own self but also puts his parents under the very strong memoirist's magnifying lens. The results can be uncomfortable, to say the least, but are always compelling. This is a mature book in all the important ways: evenhanded toward the parents who raised him, and not trying to score points or twist the knife but just trying to understand.","[biography-and-memoir, book-club-ideas, family-matters, funny-stuff, seriously-great-writing]",0679643753,9780679643753

In <em>Being Mortal,</em>the ever thoughtful surgeon and author Atul Gawande asks us to think about what it really means to age gracefully and die with dignity when modern medicine can do so much to extend life.

There he tries to steal the clan's ancestral god, planning to smuggle the statue to a New York dealer for a high price. With deft plotting and sharp characters, this is an exploration of identity and belonging; desire and thwarted ambition. Ike's homecoming is a disaster and he is a man in whom there is little to admire, but Okey Ndibe imbues him with humanity and pathos that has the reader rooting for him to the bitter, unhappy end.","[book-club-ideas, realistic-fiction, tales-from-around-the-world]",1616954582,9781616954581
Caitlin Moran,How To Build A Girl: A Novel,"Halfway through <em>How To Build A Girl</em> I put the book down, sighed, and wondered if I should just barrel through and finish it in one night, or savor it for another day. There's something about Caitlin Moran's mixture of noisy fun and social commentary that's a very happy place for a reader to hang out. The book follows the misadventures of Johanna Morrigan — an awkward, hilarious teen who decides that the path to reinvention will entail becoming a hard-drinking, oft-sexed rock critic. Her adventures are hilarious, and oddly relatable even when they're sitcom-zany. If anyone knows how to build a girl, it's Moran — she's put adolescence on the page in a book that's humming with authenticity.

It's the story of two Tamil families displaced and upended by the violent ethnic conflict between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamils. First-time author Rohini Mohan has produced an astonishing feat of reportage here, one that is richly detailed and gracefully written. Prior to reading, I knew next to nothing about this lush, remote corner of the world. Now I find myself breathlessly tracking the progress of an U.N. war crimes investigation into the events of that dark period.","[npr-staff-picks, book-club-ideas, eye-opening-reads, family-matters, science-and-society, tales-from-around-the-world]",1781686009,9781781686003
Ali Smith,How To Be Both: A Novel,"There are two published editions of this odd, bifurcated novel. Depending on which copy you end up with, you'll either start with the story of the artist Francesco del Cossa, a Renaissance Italian fresco painter, or that of George, short for Georgia, a ‘60s teenager who recently lost her mother. Either way you will have the delightful experience of reading something truly innovative. The stories illuminate each other differently based on the order in which you encounter them. And the writing isn't outpaced by the inventiveness of the structure — it's vivid and tender and funny. And what a feat! — a book so tightly constructed that it contains not just two narratives that themselves explore duality, but two wholly different encounters with the book itself.","[npr-staff-picks, book-club-ideas, for-art-lovers, historical-fiction, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing]",0375424105,9780375424106

Dinaw Mengestu,All Our Names,"In <em>All Our Names,</em> Dinaw Mengestu explores the nature of loneliness and love, violence and identity. The story is told by two narrators: Isaac is a young man who flees revolution in Uganda to seek refuge in America; and Helen is a white woman, a social worker assigned to his case, who has never left the Midwest. It's the 1970s and the taboo against mixed-race couples is still powerful, but the two fall into a passionate and secretive affair. Other kinds of secrets emerge as Isaac's story unfolds and Helen begins to understand that he has left his real identity, and much more, back in Uganda. There is nothing simple about their affair; it is born out of loneliness and complicated by prejudice and war.

Anne Leckie,Ancillary Sword,"Anne Leckie's debut, <em>Ancillary Justice,</em> provided vast distances, sentient spaceships and a galactic empire in crisis. Against this grand backdrop there was a thoughtful examination of loyalty and the fragmentation of identity. Set in the same world of Imperial Radch, her second book finds the protagonist Breq tasked with the protection of the sibling of a friend she fatally betrayed. Once part of the shared consciousness of a mighty warship and all its troops, Breq is now a soldier, reduced to a single body and mind — confined and mortal. Through her, the reader is urged to examine just what it is that makes us truly human.","[science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing]",0316246654,9780316246651
Jacqueline Woodson,Brown Girl Dreaming,"Earlier this year, when I spent a day with Jacqueline Woodson for a story, I saw that the realness she brings to her writing is also present in person, allowing her to captivate grade-school students with her stories about life and her lessons about acceptance. In this book, she uses free verse to tell the story of growing up in a segregated South. It's for children as much as it is for adults; the themes — of aching for home, searching for family support and discovering one's voice — will resonate with everyone. It's beautiful and, most important, accessible.","[npr-staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, poetry, science-and-society, young-adult]",0399252517,9780399252518
Kate Samworth,Aviary Wonders Inc. Spring Catalog And Instruction Manual,"This might be the weirdest picture book published this year. Its premise is that in the future (2031 to be exact) birds will be extinct. Or at least, birds as we know them. It begins, ""Whether you are looking for a companion, want to make something beautiful, or just want to listen to birdsong, we'll supply everything you need to build your own bird."" The next 30 pages are an illustrated catalog of wings, legs, tails, combs, and feathers. In the back are ""Assembly Instructions"" (""Step 2: Attaching The Beak."") The illustrations are serious art — full-color paintings that would look at home in a museum. At its heart the book is a warning about habitat destruction, but mostly, it will make you laugh, and children with a sense of whimsy will be delighted to imagine building a bird.

James Ellroy,Perfidia: A Novel,"James Ellroy is back in 1940s Los Angeles with <em>Perfidia,</em> the first book in a new series. It covers just a few weeks around the bombing of Pearl Harbor, when all of America (and LA in particular) is descending into madness and xenophobic fury. The plot revolves around the ritual murder of a Japanese family, but the big draw for Ellroy fans is the opportunity to see some of his already famous characters (like Dudley Smith, most notably) in the hotblooded viciousness of their youth. It's a beautiful, violent, epic novel about a dark time in America that's too often made glossy and bright in our memories.","[for-history-lovers, historical-fiction, mysteries-and-thrillers, rather-long, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side]",0307956997,9780307956996

Tom Rob Smith,The Farm,"This is easily the novel I talked about the most this year and most adamantly pressed into other people's hands. British author Tom Rob Smith is a thriller writer, but of the literary, fiercely smart variety. Here, he found inspiration in real life — his life. In 2009, Smith received a startling phone call from his father in Sweden, where his parents had retired to a small, remote farm. His father said he had put his wife, Smith's mother, in a psychiatric hospital. Smith's mother called soon after, saying that his father was lying and was involved in a criminal conspiracy. She would fly back to London to tell her son everything. Which parent to believe? He had no cause to doubt either, and his mother had never shown any sign of mental illness before. From this beginning, Smith spins a novel of doubt and secrets set in a bleak yet beautiful Swedish landscape.","[npr-staff-picks, book-club-ideas, family-matters, mysteries-and-thrillers, realistic-fiction, tales-from-around-the-world, the-dark-side]",446550736,9784465507366
George Clinton,"Brothas Be, Yo Like George, Ain't That Funkin' Kinda Hard On You? A Memoir","You had to expect that Parliament-Funkadelic producer-visionary George Clinton would give his memoir a title just as jovial, provocative and kaleidoscope-colorful as his 50-year musical <em>oeuvre</em> (not to mention his trademark rainbow hairstyle). This page-turner gives us real insight into the roots of Clintonian genius: He innovated a new amalgam of funk, rock, metal and pop in the 1960s and ‘70s by bringing together his love for Motown, Jimi Hendrix, mambo, science fiction, Aristotelian philosophy and subversive political humor. The memoir's last third sobers us up: While hip-hop samplers help extend Clinton's legacy, the musician finds himself more often in court, fighting copyright infringement, than in the studio. The book is ultimately a parable of a postwar hippie's creativity hemmed in not by sex, drugs and rock ‘n' roll but by the gravity of a cynical and twisted music business.","[npr-staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, for-music-lovers]",1476751072,9781476751078

See, author Lisa Fain is from the Houston area and Mom's from El Paso. As far as my mother is concerned, Houston might as well be New Orleans. But a few weeks later, Mom fessed up: ""The recipes are fantastic."" Fain's new cookbook — like her first — is based on her <a href= ""http://www.homesicktexan.com/"" target=""_blank"">hugely popular blog</a> and relies on her spectacular photography and personable authorial presence for much of its charm. (And, Mom will have you know, it attends to the state's many cuisines.) The recipes in it are inventive, inviting, unpretentious and easy to follow: turkey enchiladas with sweet potato-chipotle sauce, black-eyed pea and Mexican chorizo soup, and jalapeno fried chicken, which calls for brining the bird with jalapenos for a long chili finish.

Eleanor Davis,How To Be Happy,"Eleanor Davis doesn't really tell readers how to be happy. Instead, she draws comics full of hilarious surrealism, gut-tugging tropes and eloquent despair. Her characters, on the other hand, do strive for happiness, or at least safety. Many aim to control their emotions with the aid of workshops, technology or even artificial societies. Rich colors and elegant line work elevate their efforts. Members of one inventive crew zip themselves up in a giant bag, protected from the world. Another, wiser character says, ""Find the stories that make you stronger.""

Simply put, this is the best, most urgent book I've read about art this year. Through rigorous research and furiously fine storytelling, Masha Gessen places the band's founding members unflinchingly into context, revealing the worlds they move between (of Russian activists, intellectuals and prisoners) and reminding us that art really can change the world — if you're an artist with the guts to try.","[npr-staff-picks, eye-opening-reads, for-art-lovers, for-music-lovers, science-and-society, tales-from-around-the-world]",1594632197,9781594632198

I love them for their beauty, for the sense of adventure they represent and for the hilarious misunderstandings. (California as an island, for instance.) But I didn't know much about them until I read <em>The Map Thief.</em> In it, Michael Blanding tells the story of E. Forbes Smiley III, a dealer of rare, antique maps who, when he got in over his head, started stealing — and selling — maps from prominent libraries. Using wonderful reproductions, Blanding teaches the reader about the political, economic and practical uses of mapmaking since the 15th century.

John Darnielle,Wolf In White Van: A Novel,"In his taut, haunting novel, John Darnielle goes deep into the consciousness of a damaged kid turned isolated adult who builds a game that changes lives, by design and by accident. The protagonist, Sean Phillips, is unforgettable — brilliant, innocent, self-corrupted and a master of his imagined realm who, because of injuries he sustained as a teen, can't drink out of a regular beer can. Darnielle lets Phillips tell his own story in remembrances that surface like points on an interactive map; the book's structure is hypnotic and its plot feels epic, though not many encounters actually take place. One of indie rock's great balladeers, Darnielle uses his gift for imagining whole lives in three-minute songs to open up a rich and hidden sphere that shows us much about adolescence, the imagination and the fluctuating nature of destiny.","[npr-staff-picks, for-music-lovers, its-all-geek-to-me, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side]",0374292086,9780374292089

Lines were pulled out to suggest that Robert M. Gates — the only defense secretary ever asked to stay on by the next president — had turned on the boss. But at its core, <em>Duty</em> is so much more than just a report card on the current administration. It's a heartfelt — and sometimes heartbreaking — account of a challenging time in American history. Gates does indulge in a bit of score-settling — Vice President Biden probably won't be buying extra copies of <em>Duty</em> to use as stocking stuffers this Christmas. Yet what shines forth is Gates' fundamental decency, his respect for military bigwigs as well as common soldiers, and his love for his country.","[biography-and-memoir, eye-opening-reads, rather-long, science-and-society]",0307959473,9780307959478

(Herman Melville drew almost exclusively upon the story of the Tryal to write his own floating gothic masterpiece of a short novel, <em>Benito Cereno,</em> in 1855.) Grandin tells the harrowing story of the 72 desperate slaves aboard the Tryal to fan out and explore the explosion of the slave trade in the Americas in the early 19th century. <em>The Empire of Necessity</em> is a wonder of power, precision and sheer reading pleasure about human horror and degradation.","[eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, science-and-society]",805094539,9788050945397

In tiny snippets of language, Davis manages to pack every essential element of a good read: characters, history, action, plot and feeling.","[npr-staff-picks, poetry, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing]",0374118582,9780374118587
Kelly DiPucchio and Christian Robinson,Gaston,"Three things happened to me when I read this enchanting picture book about a mixed-up French bulldog raised by a family of prim, proper French poodles: First, I wanted to crumple up the whole world and commission a new one painted by Christian Robinson. Second, I wanted a French bulldog even more than usual, which is saying something, because I already dream of owning one with an intensity usually reserved for diamonds or beachfront property. And third, I wanted to hug the book to my heart and never, ever let it go. I've only done the third — for now.

Francine Prose,"Lovers At The Chameleon Club, Paris 1932: A Novel","This novel was inspired by <a href= ""http://www.clevelandart.org/art/1992.97"" target=""_blank"">a photograph</a> of a lesbian couple taken at a Paris nightclub just before World War II. One of the women pictured is Violette Morris, a cross-dressing athlete and race car driver who became a Nazi spy and torturer. Morris is Lou Villars in Francine Prose's novel, which tells Lou's story from several perspectives, including the photographer's. When her racing license is taken away because of how she dresses, Lou becomes easy prey for the manipulations of Adolf Hitler. It doesn't end well for Lou, who winds up in the hands of the French Resistance. Prose's book is a strange ride through the glittery, shallow world of Paris in the shadow of war. It's also a cautionary tale that probes both the roots of evil and the nature of gender.","[npr-staff-picks, for-history-lovers, historical-fiction, realistic-fiction]",0061713783,9780061713781

Gregory's near-future world is a fascinating look at a society where the brain has become the final battlefield of faith, pleasure and commerce, and he puts together a ripping story that's essentially one long chase sequence as his characters fight to stop the distribution of a new party drug that might just mean the end of the world.","[mysteries-and-thrillers, science-and-society, science-fiction-and-fantasy, the-dark-side]",0765336928,9780765336927
Jung Chang,Empress Dowager Cixi: The Concubine Who Launched Modern China,"Empress Cixi — a low-ranking consort who became regent for her son and ruled for four decades — is often perceived as a viciously insular ruler who brought down the Qing dynasty, China's last emperors. Jung Chang is out to change that, with a biography that takes on elements of the best political thrillers. Chang's sympathy for Cixi is strongly in evidence in this fascinating story, and her ability to assemble context unobtrusively in the background makes her exhaustive research seem effortless. <em>Cixi</em> is one of those necessary biographies that illuminate an era, as well as recounting a life.","[biography-and-memoir, for-history-lovers, tales-from-around-the-world]",0307456706,9780307456700

This is not, however, a young adult novel (not that there's anything wrong with that); this is literary fiction with young adults as the subject. <em>The Fever</em> loosely takes its jumping-off point from real life: the mysterious illness that struck girls in Le Roy, N.Y., causing them to twitch and spasm uncontrollably. Combining vaccination anxieties, teenage jealousies and an overall sense of something really bad happening, this is the kind of book you can start on takeoff and not put down until you absolutely have to.","[npr-staff-picks, mysteries-and-thrillers, realistic-fiction, the-dark-side]",0316231053,9780316231053

It's a dark and bloody tale, but Galbraith's wicked, knowing characterization of British publishing types makes it disturbingly funny, too. The murder being investigated in <em>The Silkworm</em> is that of an author who is universally disliked.

It's not sufficient to call Nahm's novel a book about memory and loss, although he explores those themes gracefully and insightfully. This is a heartbreaking story about real people enduring unspeakable pain, two siblings who ""were rippling reflections of one another"" — one who's gone, and one who almost is.","[family-matters, rather-short, realistic-fiction, the-dark-side]",1937512207,9781937512200
Sarah Addison Allen,Lost Lake,"Recently widowed Kate and her 8-year-old daughter escape the machinations of her politician mother-in-law by fleeing to her Great Aunt Eby's declining resort, Lost Lake. Eby is ready to sell the property, much to the chagrin of a handful of loyal regulars, but Kate's visit reunites her with her preteen summer love, Wes — and changes everything. Populated with a quirky cast of characters, most of whom have haunted pasts, <em>Lost Lake</em> is Sarah Addison Allen's most emotionally complex book to date, but it maintains her signature ability to weave enchantment seamlessly into an already rich storyline.","[book-club-ideas, family-matters, lets-talk-about-sex, love-stories, realistic-fiction]",125001980X,9781250019806
"Daniel Kehlmann, translated by Carol Janeway",F: A Novel,"Long after their father heeds a hypnotist's advice to make his most secret dreams reality and in the process abruptly deserts his wife and young sons, the three brothers, now grown — and all failures in their various professions (a priest who doesn't believe in God; a painter who specializes in forging the work of great artists; and a financial wizard who compulsively cheats his clients) — take turns describing their particular road to self-understanding.

Coe Booth,Kinda Like Brothers,"Eleven-year-old Jarrett deals with a constant flow of foster babies shuffling in and out of his home. His mom is a foster parent and the book begins with a toddler and her 12-year-old brother coming for a much-longer-than-usual stay. Coe Booth perfectly captures the two boys in their backstabbing antics, their arguments over girls and, eventually, their transition from strangers to enemies to ""kinda like brothers."" Before Booth was a writer, she was a caseworker with Child Protective Services in New York. She told NPR: ""I was always wondering: What would it be like for those kids to have these new kids come and leave and come and leave and not want to attach to them?""

""My writing life and my life with computers … seem mirrored, computer twinned,"" writes Vikram Chandra. ""Both are explorations of process, of the unfolding of connections."" He describes the seductiveness of DOS, his own journeyman coding, and how ""hard-core"" programmer Steve Wozniak single-handedly set off the personal computer revolution.

Lauren Beukes,Broken Monsters,"Fiercely smart, caustically creative, defiantly feminist, Lauren Beukes has pioneered a new genre: the technothriller set amid crumbling cities. <em>Broken Monsters</em> is a grim mystery that lives at the intersection of cold electronic gadgets and the blood-hot desires of the human beings who wield them. The novel is set in Detroit, where Detective Gabriella Versado is assigned to find out who killed a boy and then attached the top half of his body to the bottom half of a deer. Here, as in her brilliant 2013 novel, <em>The Shining Girls,</em> Beukes writes like a combination of Agatha Christie and Don DeLillo. You're drawn in by the whodunit and then cold-cocked by the succinct, electrifying prose.","[lets-talk-about-sex, mysteries-and-thrillers, rather-long, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side]",0316216828,9780316216821

Greil Marcus,The History Of Rock 'N' Roll In Ten Songs,"No writer puts you inside the experience of music the way Greil Marcus does. His descriptions of songs, especially, unfold like thrillers or romantic rhapsodies, sucking you in and revealing aspects of each beat or vocal trill that you'd never have noticed on your own. As the most esteemed music writer of his generation, Marcus has made a career of challenging conventional wisdom on everything from Elvis to punk to Bob Dylan's <em>Basement Tapes.</em> Here, he re-imagines the very idea of rock history as a series of associations rather than chronological events. You may have never thought to connect Joy Division's ""<a href= ""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dBt3mJtgJc"" target=""_blank"">Transmission</a>"" to Buddy Holly's ""<a href= ""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL9SysD0WyM"" target=""_blank""> Crying, Waiting, Hoping,</a>"" or Christian Marclay's video- and sound-installation Guitar Drag to the Teddy Bears' ""<a href= ""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCnUsInBQws"" target=""_blank"">To Know Him Is To Love Him</a>,"" but you'll think of music differently because Marcus did.

This <em>cri de coeur</em> of a girl who is raped by her uncle while growing up with a punitively religious mother and a learning disabled brother who dies of brain cancer certainly isn't cheerful, and it's not for everyone.

The book is for very young dancers who may not see many people who look like them in the world of ballet. It's illustrated by Christopher Myers, whose collagelike work is painterly, vivid and emotional. Copeland's writing and Myers' art draw you into a beautiful world, rich with color, texture and drama.

Author Laila Lalami uses historical record to frame the life of Mustafa al-Zamori, who sells himself into slavery and finds himself caught up in world-changing events. The novel, structured like an Arabic travelogue, is told in dreamlike prose that builds in a grim, leisurely parallel, as what Mustafa knows and what we know come ever closer to a dreadful vanishing point.","[book-club-ideas, for-history-lovers, historical-fiction, tales-from-around-the-world]",0307911667,9780307911667

Embedded in her tales of ordinary people — a new employee forced to fire an incompetent co-worker; an actor on his way home after a performance full of improvisations; a mathematical theoretician working for a company that sells butterflies to be released at weddings and other events — are carefully observed human details and momentous surprises.","[poetry, realistic-fiction]",0820346878,9780820346878

Fifty-nine-year-old Fiona Maye, a family High Court judge, struggles simultaneously with her husband's determination to swing for a last passionate fling with a much younger woman, and a gnarly case involving the right of a remarkable, not-quite-18-year-old Jehovah's Witness to refuse a lifesaving blood transfusion on religious grounds. Rational Fiona, upset by her marital rift, is unmoored by an onslaught of bewildering emotions. <em>The Children Act</em> raises intriguing questions about both religious and romantic devotion, legality versus morality, and where professional responsibilities end and personal ones begin.","[book-club-ideas, eye-opening-reads, family-matters, love-stories, realistic-fiction, science-and-society, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side]",0385539703,9780385539708

The character Verna in the title story is a serial husband-killer who goes on a cruise of the Arctic, where she sets her deadly designs on someone from long in her past.

Philippa Gregory,The King's Curse,"If you, too, have been worried that the great Philippa Gregory was going to run out of angles to tell the story of Henry VIII and the fortunes and reversals of the Tudors — I think you can rest easy. The latest in her thankfully never-ending saga is <em>The King's Curse,</em> the very sad tale of Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury. Frankly, all these books have a similar feel. Henry VIII ascends the throne, hope rises, many girl babies are born, paranoia sets in, heads roll. But no worries; there's always the knowledge that Elizabeth I will eventually take power in front of a huge screen that says FEMINIST. Added bonuses: This one has a glimpse of young Henry's early pathological anxiety, and a charismatic main character — Margaret Pole is tenacious and intelligent. Plus, there  are a date with an executioner, a moral victory, and more ancillary characters who may get their own books in the future.

But as members of the family enter adulthood and some of them move away from the farm, you realize that Smiley is creating a rich universe rooted in the intimate details of family life and set against the all-encompassing sweep of history.","[npr-staff-picks, book-club-ideas, family-matters, for-history-lovers, historical-fiction, realistic-fiction]",0307700313,9780307700315

Each Iremonger has a birth object, a seemingly random item to which he must always be near, lest he sicken and fade away.

Lila by contrast has no roots: She was abused as a child, then rescued by a woman who brought her up as part of a makeshift family of migrant workers.

That book illuminated the importance of literature in a theocracy. This one is an impassioned call to reading in a democracy. Using Mark Twain's <em> The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,</em> Sinclair Lewis' <em>Babbitt</em> and Carson McCullers' <em>The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,</em> Nafisi argues that Americans, so gifted and lucky to live in a democracy, have begun to take reading for granted and marginalize the books that made us great.

Particularly fascinating are the portraits juxtaposing Freud's subjects with his paintings of them, eloquently revealing how they were transformed by his art. We see David Hockney sitting, hands folded, beside his fleshier close-up on the easel, while whippet-thin Freud, in characteristic knotted scarf and untied boots, is caught frozen in the doorway clutching a fistful of brushes, as if at the scene of a crime.

On massive, 16-inch-by-21-inch pages (the same size as those on which McCay drew his seminal newspaper cartoon), some of the most exciting artists working in comics have created wildly diverse interpretations of Nemo and his exploits.  Some contributors update Nemo; others subvert his Edwardian-era cheeriness; many simply send him on new adventures, re-creating McCay's style with startling facility. They're not very dreamlike, but these comics, like McCay's, are more enjoyable than the sweetest slumber.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, for-art-lovers, rather-short, science-fiction-and-fantasy]",0989907694,9780989907699
Ian Haney López,Dog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism And Wrecked The Middle Class,"It's a bracing premise: Indirect messages centered on stereotypes about minorities have persuaded middle-class and poor white people to support a government controlled by wealthy elites. While obvious racism is repudiated today, public life is filled with covert messages about who uses welfare more or who commits more crime, calibrated to reach white voters. Ian Haney López traces stereotypes of black criminality to the end of slavery, when Southern states used criminal convictions to lease black convicts out as forced labor. But his most depressing thesis is simple: Many who believe these messages are not hate-filled bigots but decent people, simply misled by the dog whistle.","[npr-staff-picks, eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, science-and-society]",0199964270,9780199964277
Patrick Leigh Fermor,The Broken Road: From The Iron Gates To Mount Athos,"This is the very long awaited conclusion to Patrick Leigh Fermor's unforgettable, three-part travelogue, which describes his adventures during a walk from the Hook of Holland to Constantinople (a name he romantically preferred to Istanbul) as a young man in the early 1930s. The first volume, published in 1977, astonished readers with its picaresque cast of characters and vast, seemingly effortless erudition about between-wars Europe and the myriad shifting empires that preceded it. The second volume, published in 1986, was equally celebrated, but the end of the tale lay unfinished for decades, as an aging Fermor suffered from writer's block. Finished posthumously by travel writer Colin Thubron and Fermor biographer Artemis Cooper, <em>The Broken Road</em> describes Fermor's arrival in Istanbul and his push on to Greece, where he eventually made his home. Occupying a place somewhere between fiction and nonfiction — Fermor was said to have had a prodigious memory, but admitted later that he'd taken some liberties filling in the blanks — the trilogy stands out for its lyrical prose and piercing intelligence, both lightly worn.","[npr-staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, tales-from-around-the-world]",1590177541,9781590177549

Cece Bell,El Deafo,"It's been a banner year for children's graphic novel memoirs — and the best of the bunch is Cece Bell's <em>El Deafo.</em> Profoundly deaf after a bout with meningitis, Cece starts first grade with the help of a new hearing device, a Phonic Ear, which is big and clunky and strapped to her chest. The Phonic Ear makes her different, sure, but it also transmits her teacher's voice directly to her hearing aid, which makes her feel like a superhero: El Deafo! Cece has a tough time connecting with her peers — this is, of course, difficult whether you're hard of hearing or not. The book portrays some heart-wrenching struggles, but what's notable is Cece's authentic positivity throughout the experience. The book is wonderfully detailed about the emotional and practical challenges she faces, and it's also laugh-out-loud funny at times. (A lip-reading Cece mistakes a student telling her ""my grandma may die"" for ""my grandma makes pies."") The art is charming — all the characters have bunny faces and ears — and despite its length, it's a book that a variety of ages can enjoy.","[npr-staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, comics-and-graphic-novels, eye-opening-reads, family-matters, kids-books]",1419712179,9781419712173

It's a book where teenagers think in almost indulgently poetic language while still sounding genuinely adolescent. It's two separate but equally intoxicating love stories. It's the story of Noah at 13, falling for the magic boy next door. And it's the story of his twin sister, Jude, three years later, haunted by her mom's spiteful ghost and barely speaking with the twin who used to feel like half of her own self. And, most of all, it's the mystery of what happened to tear Noah and Jude apart, and what — if anything — can bring them back together again.","[family-matters, lets-talk-about-sex, love-stories, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing, young-adult]",0803734964,9780803734968

The story begins in apartheid South Africa and ends on a potato farm in modern-day Sweden. Along the way, Jonasson delivers well-developed characters and satire that's spot-on.

Thankfully, Henderson's Montana is a good deal darker than that of my childhood; his characters and vivid portrayal of the state and all its poverty make for a fascinating read. The plot centers on a social worker who involves himself in the life of a reclusive family just as the father starts to attract the attention of the FBI.

There are delighted children, people jumping and waving — just a few moments of normalcy in a town that, a year later, would be devastated when the Nazis marched into Poland. When a young woman recognizes her grandfather Moszek Tuchendler, now Maurice Chandler, as a grinning teenager in footage Kurtz posts online, he begins to reconstruct a vanished world. A combination of luck and hard work reveals the harrowing story of some of the Polish Jews in the town — a community of 3,000, of whom fewer than 100 people survived. It's an unusual Holocaust tale — a reconstruction of the moment just <em>before</em> the shadow that fell on Europe, and it reminds us that the horror wasn't just the violence itself, but the loss of a vibrant, joyful, bustling life.","[npr-staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, eye-opening-reads, family-matters, for-history-lovers, science-and-society, tales-from-around-the-world]",0374276773,9780374276775
James Booth,"Philip Larkin: Life, Art And Love","Whether the new biography of poet Philip Larkin is for you will depend on two things: whether you adore the poetry (you do? Let's be friends!), and if you're interested in hearing more about the softer side of Larkin. The other side is well-known — there is plenty of evidence to suggest Larkin was a real jerk: a bigot, a misogynist, a drunk. This biography is by James Booth, who knew him for almost two decades and accentuates Larkin's kinder attributes. Even as a die-hard fan of the poetry, I don't know enough to weigh in on who he really was — and in many ways, Booth may seem like an apologist — but there's still pleasure in the argument itself, and in the many detailed critical passages. Is Booth's funnier, affectionate Larkin the real man? Maybe, maybe not — but no matter who he was, he's still the man who wrote <em>An Arundel Tomb.</em> ""What will survive of us is love.""","[npr-staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, for-art-lovers, poetry, rather-long]",1620407817,9781620407813

Cameron Conaway,"Malaria, Poems","When a collection like <em>Malaria, Poems</em> comes along, the world must take notice. In the spirit of social consciousness, Cameron Conaway does the work of calling our attention to a disease that kills over 627,000 people a year. Call it the poetry of awareness: Through beautifully realized and scientifically sound lyrics, Conaway educates us on subjects ranging from the <em>Anopheles</em> mosquito, which transmits the disease, to the gray market in false remedies. The work, while deeply cerebral, manages to get to the heart of the issue with intense power.","[eye-opening-reads, poetry, science-and-society, tales-from-around-the-world]",1611861446,9781611861440
René Steinke,Friendswood: A Novel,"Texas is a huge, complicated state, and it's sometimes a difficult one for authors to get right. Not so for René Steinke, whose <em>Friendswood</em> does a near-perfect job capturing the feel not just of the titular city but of southeast Texas as a whole. Steinke's chronicle of the residents of a town dealing with — and denying — a recent environmental disaster is disturbing and thought-provoking, and one of the most interesting novels to be set in the Lone Star State in quite a while.","[book-club-ideas, family-matters, realistic-fiction, science-and-society]",1594632510,9781594632518

In the shadow of his best friend, the popular and athletic Cade, and forever tied to his fictional namesake in his father's best-selling sci-fi novel, Finn has trouble figuring out who he's supposed to be.

While the characters on the main page chat, dance or vacuum, windows appear showing what's going on decades or centuries distant.

Here, finally, the guitarist shares details about how he assembles his bands, the genesis of his first four groundbreaking albums and how his multi-Grammy-winning album <em>Supernatural</em> changed his band's life. But the best part is the chapter where Santana expands on the personal philosophy he often shares with his live audiences: ""[I] tell them about the light that they each have inside them, that they <em>are</em> light — <em>luminous</em> is the word I like to use. I ask them to please consider accepting the … greatness of their lives.""

And Rendell is certainly prolific. If my count is correct, this is her 65th book. On the surface, it's a mystery about the present-day discovery of a long-buried tin box with the skeletal remains of two hands inside (one belonging to a man, the other to a woman). As with so much of Rendell's work, what matters is the psychological tangle underneath the surface. In this case, it's a group of men and women who, as children, played together in the fields of a London neighborhood where the tin was buried during World War II. But the crime isn't the star here; it's the childhood friends who are pulled back together decades later, and the tremendous capacity for growth and change some of them show even well into their ""golden years.""","[npr-staff-picks, for-history-lovers, historical-fiction, mysteries-and-thrillers, realistic-fiction, tales-from-around-the-world, the-dark-side]",1476784329,9781476784328

But we who enjoy debating the 1921 manslaughter accusations against slapstick comedian Fatty Arbuckle or the relative merits of the Gish sisters are likely to also adore William J. Mann's investigation into one of Hollywood's oldest whodunits — the murder of director William Desmond Taylor. To be sure, Mann's conclusion is hardly groundbreaking, but that's almost beside the point. The author, a skilled biographer of such screen greats as Katharine Hepburn and Elizabeth Taylor, brings the early days of the movie industry to sparkling life on the page, whether he's evoking Los Angeles' demimonde or explaining how the era's scandals drove the film industry toward protectionism in the face of morality campaigns.","[npr-staff-picks, for-art-lovers, for-history-lovers, rather-long, science-and-society, the-dark-side]",0062242164,9780062242167

While, given its multiple voices and perspectives, it may not be the definitive Bolaño biography, it's a fun and enveloping read for the already initiated.","[biography-and-memoir, tales-from-around-the-world]",1612193471,9781612193472

Everyone considers it a robbery gone wrong, but Lecouvreur thinks the attack may have been politically motivated.

Cixin Liu,The Three-Body Problem,"Science fiction is big in China, occupying a ""rather unique place in the culture and literature,"" according to scholar Xia Jia. Despite this, we in the Western world don't get to see much Chinese sci fi because of the language barrier. Luckily for us, this new translation of <em>The Three-Body Problem</em> opens up the worlds imagined by one of China's most popular writers. Cixin Liu makes well-worn genre concepts fresh and exciting again and explores technology, human interaction and metaphysics from a distinctly different perspective. If you love hard science fiction with a bit of thriller thrown in, you need this book.","[science-and-society, science-fiction-and-fantasy, tales-from-around-the-world]",765377063,9787653770634
Andrea Nguyen,The Banh Mi Handbook: Recipes For Crazy-Delicious Vietnamese Sandwiches,"So you don't think you could ever make banh mi, your favorite Vietnamese sandwich? Andrea Nguyen begs to differ. Her highly focused book has everything you need to pull it off: the pickles, the pates, the sauces, even the bread — all written in the meticulous, foolproof style that's made Nguyen one of my favorite cookbook authors. There are easy variations and alternatives and shortcuts, and a whole lot of droolworthy protein. Would it be easier to just scrape together your pennies and head to the nearest banh mi joint? Possibly. But the point is, now you don't have to.","[cookbooks-and-food, tales-from-around-the-world]",160774533X,9781607745334
Maria Dahvana Headley and Kat Howard,The End Of The Sentence,"This novella is as dark and rich as European drinking chocolate, both in the story it tells and in the way it's written. Malcolm Mays tries to escape the horror of his life by moving to a house in rural Oregon, only to fall into a new horror when letters begin to arrive from Dusha Chuchonnyhoof, who claims to be the owner. Dusha is due to return — after 117 years — and that's only one part of the unsettling unreality at the heart of this story. Kat Howard and Maria Dahvana Headley's separate styles blend beautifully here, as do myth and folklore, in this intricate and elegantly forged plot.","[mysteries-and-thrillers, rather-short, science-fiction-and-fantasy, the-dark-side]",1596066792,9781596066793
Ruth Goodman,How To Be A Victorian: A Dawn-To-Dusk Guide To Victorian Life,"You'll never look at a period piece the same way again. Ruth Goodman, a historian who lives her studies, takes the ""Dawn to Dusk"" approach seriously. Her re-creation of Victorian life begins with stepping out of bed — a vastly different experience depending on your social class — and spreads out into an immersive explanation of social history, whether buying a train ticket or dressing for dinner. Ably encompassing a wide range of class experiences across decades of unimaginably swift social and economic change, Goodman's book is the cheapest time-travel machine you'll find this year.","[eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, science-and-society]",0871404850,9780871404855
Margarita Carrillo Arronte,Mexico: The Cookbook,"Mexican chef and food activist Margarita Carrillo is an enthusiastic and comprehensive guide to her country's cuisine in Mexico: The Cookbook — which looks daunting at nearly 700 pages — but the purposefully simple recipes provide a stress-free introduction to Mexico's vast culinary history. While the food has evolved through the centuries, Carrillo says, ""you can eat the same tortilla that Moctezuma ate 500 years ago.""","[npr-staff-picks, cookbooks-and-food, rather-long, tales-from-around-the-world]",0714867527,9780714867526
Ed Brubaker and Sean Philips,"Fatale Deluxe Edition, Vol. 1","A raven-haired dame with a mysterious power over men flees from a cult in this virtuoso noir tale. Ed Brubaker's fiendishly addictive story unspools in three different time periods: When the intoxicating Josephine is working her magic in the 1950s, Sean Phillips gets to splash out on classic clothes and vintage spaces. Then, when we're transported to the '70s, he captures the change in atmosphere without missing a beat. Josephine is an irresistible cipher trapped by her own seductive web, and the H.P.

Charles Phan,The Slanted Door: Modern Vietnamese Food,"Charles Phan's latest has a few of those recipes that are the gold standard for any adventurous cook — things like Roasted Mushroom And Yuba Salad, that despite mercifully short instruction lists will still send you to the back of your local Chinese market to search unmarked plastic bags for an ingredient you've never seen or heard of. Nonchefs will also enjoy Phan's gently self-effacing stories of the restaurant business — one dish, the Hainan Chicken, barely sells, but Phan is determined to keep it on the menu because he thinks it's the ""purest [way] to enjoy a chicken's natural flavor and texture.""

Cynthia Kadohata,Half A World Away,"<em>Half a World Away</em> by Cynthia Kadohata will hit you right in the heart and gut. We meet Jaden, who's 12, obsessed with electricity and adopted from Romania four years earlier: ""When his mother left him, he'd been so out of his mind that he hadn't even screamed and cried; he'd howled."" Jaden is trying to decide whether he loves his adoptive parents, who are on the verge of adopting another child — a process that Kadohata shows in grim detail. As in her National Book Award-winning novel, <em>The Thing About Luck,</em> Kadohata takes readers to <em>such</em> a particular place — a story like none you've read — while hitting universal nerves. Just terrific. (For ages 10 to 14)","[npr-staff-picks, family-matters, realistic-fiction, tales-from-around-the-world, young-adult]",1442412755,9781442412750
Kurtis J. Wiebe and Roc Upchurch,Rat Queens Vol. 1: Sass And Sorcery,"By the far-reaching tentacles of N'Rygoth! Look up ""rowdy"" in the dictionary and you'll probably find portraits of Hannah, Dee, Violet and Betty, the butt-kicking, name-taking (OK, also drug-taking) band of mercenary fighters known as the Rat Queens. This medievalesque swords'n'sorcery sendup has a massive following among women — and for good reason: The Rat Queens are the very best kind of strong female characters. Their flaws are believable, their friendships are solid (if liberally peppered with expletives) <em>and</em> they can rid your town of trolls — for a hefty price, of course.","[npr-staff-picks, comics-and-graphic-novels, funny-stuff, rather-short, science-fiction-and-fantasy]",1607069458,9781607069454

But Bear worries that Bunny's family might be sad and miss him, so he dutifully posts ""found"" fliers all over the forest. No one claims Bunny; Bear has grown to love him and hopes to keep him. Then Moose finds ""Floppy, my bunny!"" and Bear, though heartbroken, hands him over. But Moose has other ideas. The utterly charming illustrations and clever visual details add volumes to this tale of friendship and sharing. (For ages 3 to 6)","[family-matters, kids-books]",0802735592,9780802735591
Yuyi Morales and Tim O'Meara,Viva Frida,"In <em>Viva Frida,</em> Yuyi Morales combines fewer than 20 words with tactile, beautiful illustrations to create something astonishing: a book simple enough for very small children to understand, but complex enough to evoke the work and life of Frida Kahlo. Morales' lush illustrations, a unique combination of digital painting and meticulously photographed models of clay and felt, communicate the incredible richness of Kahlo's artistic vision and demonstrate the depth of apparently simple sentences like: ""I dream. Sueño?"" Complete with an illuminating and personal author's note, <em>Viva Frida</em> is a wonderful way to introduce kids to an incredible artist.

Farel Dalrymple,The Wrenchies,"Dangerous children face off against demons in Farel Dalrymple's nesting doll of a story. In a post-apocalyptic world, the kids known as the Wrenchies rely on jury-rigged technology, drugs and sheer cussedness to fight off bad magic. On another plane, a comic-book-loving kid yearns to belong. But who's that fascinating guy next door? Dalrymple's wire-taut drawings gain depth from painstaking watercolor washes. The distinctive way he draws faces — pinched, always ready to scream — is ideally suited to his hard-bitten characters. These kids' toils make for a fascinating grown-up read.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, science-fiction-and-fantasy, the-dark-side, young-adult]",1596434219,9781596434219
Mike Sacks,Poking A Dead Frog: Conversations With Today's Top Comedy Writers,"If you enjoy podcasts like Marc Maron's WTF and J.R. Havlan's Writer's Bloc, or if you just enjoy being serious about comedy, then this book is for you. It's filled with intelligent conversations about what comedy writers do but also about how hopeless it is to be one — so if you're not doing it to fill some deep emotional void, run away. Each interview and essay in here says (shocker): Write what you find funny. Even if you're not interested in a comedy writing career, at least you'll get great suggestions for your Netflix queue.","[npr-staff-picks, funny-stuff, poetry, rather-long]",0143123785,9780143123781

The way Colón captures how it feels to be engulfed and transported by your artistic endeavor, the way he evokes the perfect endlessness of solitary afternoons spent working hard on what you love best — that's anything but simple. His warm-toned, dreamy illustrations invite you into the story, and the special details — like who the protagonist shares his sandwiches with — reward repeated readings.

Walter Mosley,Debbie Doesn't Do It Anymore: A Novel,"I'm a Walter Mosley fan — I have several signed copies of his books, mostly from his Easy Rawlins detective series — but <em>Debbie Doesn't Do It Anymore</em> isn't crime fiction. Or, at least it doesn't seem that way at first. You see, Debbie Dare is a porn star. The book begins with a vividly described scene of what is, for many people, a pretty private moment — just not for Debbie. There <em>is</em> a crime in this book — several, in fact — and there's also self-discovery, recrimination, retribution, reunions and sex — all kinds and many flavors of sex. If you're at all curious about the inner workings of the porn industry, or if you've ever dreamed of doing a life makeover, give this novel a read.","[npr-staff-picks, lets-talk-about-sex, realistic-fiction]",0385526180,9780385526180
Kelly Sue DeConnick and Emma Ríos,Pretty Deadly Volume 1,"The Western genre is a veritable myth factory, and writer Kelly Sue DeConnick and artist Emma Ríos are making the most of it. The first volume of their <em>Pretty Deadly</em> series layers the detached life-and-death surrealism of Greek legends over the sweeping landscapes and grittily human towns of our shared cinematic memory. The art alternates scratchy chaos and arresting tableaux, and the crisscrossing stories, built on other stories and folded within yet more stories, become a dream-logic commentary on the West's construction of its own mythology.","[book-club-ideas, comics-and-graphic-novels, for-art-lovers, rather-short, the-dark-side]",1607069628,9781607069621

Montes' language is almost otherworldly, and his poems are, by turns, disturbing, sexy and sometimes surprisingly funny. It takes a rare talent to make sense (or something like it) of the basic weirdness of human relationships: ""My world is a structure I build in such a way that when it falls apart it falls apart gracefully. You helped in the following ways. You were there. You weren't.""","[poetry, seriously-great-writing]",0988732874,9780988732872
