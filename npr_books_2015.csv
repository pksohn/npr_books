Randall Munroe,Thing Explainer: Complicated Stuff In Simple Words,"Randall Munroe — the former NASA roboticist behind the beloved <a href=""http://xkcd.com/"" target=""_blanks"">xkcd</a> webcomic — breaks down complex stuff into simple terms ... really simple terms. The Large Hadron Collider? That's a ""Big tiny thing hitter."" The Mars rover? That's a ""Red world space car."" And for those of us who don't love heights, isn't ""fear porch"" really the best possible term for a balcony? Munroe relies exclusively on 1,000 of the most commonly used words in the English language to define and explain everything from your large intestines (""big food hallway"") to NASA shuttles (""flying space trucks."") And with witty, playful diagrams, you'll be understanding nuclear reactors (""heavy metal power buildings"") in no time.","[staff-picks, comics-and-graphic-novels, eye-opening-reads, funny-stuff, its-all-geek-to-me, nonfiction]",0544668251,9780544668256
Linda Hirshman,Sisters In Law: How Sandra Day O'Connor And Ruth Bader Ginsburg Went To The Supreme Court And Changed The World,"The title tells all: <em>Sisters in Law: How Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg Went to the Supreme Court and Changed the World.</em> Linda Hirshman's joint biography of the first and second women to serve on the nation's highest court is a gossipy, funny, sometimes infuriating and moving tale of two women so similar and yet so different. O'Connor, a lifelong Republican, was raised on a Western ranch and cut her political teeth as majority leader of the Arizona Senate. <a href=""http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/26/450547606/notorious-rbg-the-supreme-court-justice-turned-cultural-icon"" target=""_blank"">Ginsburg</a> was born and bred in Brooklyn, the daughter of a Russian Jewish immigrant, and became a professor and litigator. But as different as their backgrounds were, and even their approaches to judging, when it came to women's rights, O'Connor and Ginsburg were allies. They began their careers at a time when women could be denied jobs, credit, even a place on a jury. But they always had an amazing self-confidence, believing that they could be lawyers and leaders.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, book-club-ideas, eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, ladies-first, nonfiction]",0062238469,9780062238467
Ashlee Vance,"Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, And The Quest For A Fantastic Future","Elon Musk is a real man, but also a cartoon superhero. He decided to take on the biggest challenges on Earth — as well as in outer space — and launched not one, but three companies: Tesla Motors, the luxury electric car brand; SpaceX, the private firm that wants to slash the cost of space travel; and SolarCity, which is led by his cousin from South Africa. When I told a 5-year-old friend about the entrepreneur's life, he said, preciously: ""He is doing too much. He needs to focus."" Sound advice for a man who doesn't seem to know how to take advice. Musk is all over the place. The biography by Ashlee Vance is not. It's a page-turning read with brilliant detail. And quite a testament to the reporting. When Musk refused to participate in interviews, Vance circled his friends and family and became such a pain, the superhero caved, and talked.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, book-club-ideas, its-all-geek-to-me, nonfiction]",0062301233,9780062301239
Jamie Bartlett,The Dark Net: Inside The Digital Underworld,"<em>The Dark Net</em> is a meticulously researched and reported look at the hidden world of cryptocurrency, anonymous Web browsing and online subcultures. Information technology has carved out small spaces of almost absolute freedom while simultaneously enabling mass surveillance and tracking. Author Jamie Bartlett takes a fair, thoughtful approach to the subject, and if you've ever wondered what a bitcoin is or how both child pornographers and political freedom fighters hide out online, <em>The Dark Net</em> serves as a great introduction.","[staff-picks, its-all-geek-to-me, nonfiction, the-dark-side]",1612194893,9781612194899
Kate Beaton,"Step Aside, Pops: A Hark! A Vagrant Collection","I depend on Kate Beaton's comic strips when I need a good, hearty giggle. Her latest collection features hilarious parodies of classic literature, history and pop-culture, with brilliant caricatures of everyone from Lord Byron to Ida B. Wells and Wonder Woman. Highlights include her blistering takedowns of ""strong female characters"" and ""cool girls,"" as well as her cheeky depiction of hairy-legged, bra-burning ""straw feminists,"" who sneak into children's bedrooms to swap a Justin Bieber poster for one of a busty Mother Earth. And if you thought <em>Wuthering Heights</em> was too ridiculous to parody, Beaton finds a way to make it even more deliciously weird.","[staff-picks, comics-and-graphic-novels, for-history-lovers, funny-stuff, ladies-first, rather-short]",1770462082,9781770462083
Lynsey Addario,It's What I Do: A Photographer's Life Of Love And War,"In 2011 photojournalist Lynsey Addario was kidnapped in Libya. She was covering the fighting between dictator Moammar Gadhafi's troops and rebel forces when the car she was traveling in (with three other journalists) was ransacked. She was tied up, assaulted and held for a week. Addario's memoir, <em>It's What I Do,</em> begins with this chilling scene. In her vivid retelling, you can practically hear the bullets whiz by and taste the dirt as she's pushed to the ground with a gun held to her head. It's a story of vulnerability, humanity and courage that will give you an adrenaline rush without your moving a muscle.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, eye-opening-reads, for-art-lovers, ladies-first, nonfiction, tales-from-around-the-world]",159420537X,9781594205378
Nadia Bolz-Weber,Accidental Saints: Finding God In All The Wrong People,"I never would have guessed that my favorite interview of 2015 would be with a Lutheran minister, but Nadia Bolz-Weber isn't your average holy roller. Decked out in sleeve tattoos, she curses like a sailor and has a background in comedy. In 2008 she founded her own church, The House for All Sinners and Saints, which welcomes all walks of life — including addicts, drag queens and nonbelievers. <em>Accidental Saints</em> is a series of unflinchingly honest (and funny) stories about her life as a minister. You don't have to be religious to get something out of this book. Like this: ""Whenever people annoy me beyond reason, I can guarantee it's because they're demonstrating something I'd rather not see in myself."" This is a quick read that will leave you feeling better about yourself and others — for all our flawed, messy goodness.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, book-club-ideas, eye-opening-reads, funny-stuff, identity-and-culture, ladies-first, nonfiction]",1601427557,9781601427557
Andy Goldsworthy,Andy Goldsworthy: Ephemeral Works: 2004-2014,"Andy Goldsworthy creates art from the materials he finds in nature. His sculptures are made from ice sheets, tree branches, snow, clay and rock — he uses leaves like paint. Much of his art is meant to be ephemeral, to decay and degrade with the elements, to exist in a moment. Fortunately, Goldsworthy also photographs this work for us to enjoy and has collected 10 years of his temporary art in this beautiful coffee table book. Plus, if you've ever had the urge to just lie down outside in the rain, Goldsworthy's rain shadow photographs provide you an excuse — you're making art.

"Neil Gaiman, illustrated by JH Williams III",The Sandman: Overture,"Best-selling author Neil Gaiman made his name writing the horror/fantasy comic book series <em>The Sandman</em> about the godlike character Morpheus, the Lord of Dreaming. Its 75-issue run revealed Gaiman's seemingly limitless imagination — he wrote stories about a convention for serial killers, the gods that view hell as prime real estate for development once Lucifer abandons it, and the premiere of Shakespeare's <em>A Midsummer Night's Dream</em> held for an audience from the fairy realm. For the 25th anniversary of the comic book, Gaiman returned to his beloved characters for a six-issue miniseries. Here, Morpheus is tasked with saving the universe from complete destruction — a destruction he himself set in motion. <em>The Sandman: Overture</em> serves as a prequel to the original series and gives you the chance to read it all over again.","[staff-picks, comics-and-graphic-novels, science-fiction-and-fantasy]",1401248969,9781401248963
Ari Berman,Give Us The Ballot: The Modern Struggle For Voting Rights In America,"In 1965, LBJ signed the Voting Rights Act, wiping away obstacles that had prevented African-Americans from voting, like literacy tests and poll taxes. But what happened after the VRA became law? In <em>Give Us the Ballot,</em> Ari Berman chronicles five decades of political and ideological fights over voting rights. He argues that the law's passage birthed a ""counterrevolutionary"" movement that worked to restrict minority voters through voter ID laws, racial gerrymandering, voting purges and other efforts. Berman's book culminates with the 2013 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision that struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act. The book seems particularly interesting now that we're in the midst of the first presidential election held since that controversial decision.","[staff-picks, eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, identity-and-culture, nonfiction]",0374158274,9780374158279

Best of all, in the final illustration of Ellis' own studio (""An artist lives here""), each piece of bric-a-brac ties back to the vignettes shown previously, a detail attentive rereaders will surely find delightful.

""Mr. Smooth,"" Rudd is not — he rubs both criminals and cops the wrong way. But, in hallowed Grisham tradition, scrappy Rudd is the defense lawyer you want sitting beside you in the courtroom when things look bleak. The biggest mystery that <em>Rogue Lawyer</em> poses is how John Grisham, at this stage in his long writing career, can still concoct all these distinctive characters, tricky legal predicaments and clever ways to worm out of them.","[staff-picks, mysteries-and-thrillers]",0385539436,9780385539432

Here, Ishiguro serves up a masterful blend of fantasy, and Arthurian romance and postmodern absurdity.  In <em>The Buried Giant,</em> an exhausted group of medieval travelers cross a blasted landscape straight out of the plays and novels of Samuel Beckett.

Indeed, so antsy is Harry that when his half-brother, Mickey Haller (who is himself the hero of Connelly's ""Lincoln Lawyer"" series), asks him to sign on as an investigator, Harry surprisingly agrees.

David Mitchell,Thinking About It Only Makes It Worse (And Other Lessons From Modern Life),"There are two different famous David Mitchells — there's David Mitchell the novelist and David Mitchell the actor/comedian/panel show guest/columnist/writer. This book is written by the latter Mitchell, who is witty, clever, insightful and continually flustered by modern life. He's a British Robert Benchley, if you will. He questions and pokes at modern platitudes in a fun, mocking way — from a defense of the British habit of apologizing to a cynical analysis of the ways we spend our time and money.","[staff-picks, funny-stuff, nonfiction, tales-from-around-the-world]",1783350563,9781783350568
"Matt de la Peña, illustrated by Christian Robinson",Last Stop On Market Street,"Every week a little boy and his grandma hop on the bus after church. Along the way, they meet all kinds of people — a person with lots of tattoos, a flirty blind man, a dude playing guitar. The boy complains about the rain and about not having a car. The grandmother is stern, but loving; they don't need a car, and the rain waters the trees by the bus stop. The book features a diverse cast of characters, but it's not a book <em>about</em> diversity. It's a story about a kid and his grandma and the city, and the beauty and excitement of everyday adventures. (For ages 3 to 5)","[staff-picks, family-matters, kids-books]",0399257748,9780399257742
Larissa MacFarquhar,"Strangers Drowning: Grappling With Impossible Idealism, Drastic Choices, And The Overpowering Urge To Help","This book makes me uncomfortable, and not just in that smug way, like saying after a lecture on ethics, ""Well, at least I'm struggling with these questions, right?"" No, this book — which offers both a history of altruism and profiles of ""extreme"" altruists, like the couple who adopted 22 kids — makes me question whether I've ever done anything good in my life. But Larissa MacFarquhar writes so simply and beautifully that I forget my discomfort and just let her narrative carry me along. In fact, this is a book that would be less upsetting if it never ended, and we could all just live in her prose forever. That way we'd never have to face the upshot, which is that it's very, very difficult to be a good person.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, nonfiction, seriously-great-writing]",1594204330,9781594204333

It's an eclectic collection of recipes that hop from country to country — <em>croquetas</em> and hamburger and rendang to madeleines and cheesecake.

What do we gain, after all, by pretending we're above our own emotions?

Ta-Nehisi Coates,Between The World And Me,"Conceived as a letter from author Ta-Nehisi Coates to his son, this book punches way above its weight as provocation and analysis. Coates aims to unsettle complacency with research and bracing rhetoric. His book's central question — ""How do I live free in this black body?"" — is far less haunting, Coates argues, than the ever fresh episodes of violence against the black bodies that made this nation possible. In beautiful prose, Coates bequeaths to his child the clear-eyed approach of his parents, ""who never tried to console me with ideas of an afterlife and were skeptical of preordained American glory."" Those gifts, he maintains, make it possible for him to pose unanswerable questions without fearing the consequences.

Lucien Minor is a liar who's no good at lying, an underling to a castle servant and, what's more, a suitor to a taken woman. Still, he makes for a fitting guide — charmingly befuddled and besieged by circumstance — in this twist on the common folk tale. DeWitt takes on familiar tropes just to turn them on their heads, and the results are by turns funny, fascinating and often plain weird — a bit like Lucy himself.","[staff-picks, funny-stuff, love-stories, tales-from-around-the-world]",0062281208,9780062281203
Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan,The Red Web: The Struggle Between Russia's Digital Dictators And The New Online Revolutionaries,"<em>The Red Web</em> is an exploration of how the Russian state uses the Internet as a tool for surveillance and cyberaggression while dissidents are trying to use it as a channel for free expression. It reads like a spy novel, and there's a lot of fascinating history about the state campaign to control information, from Soviet times to today.

Matthew Palmer,Secrets Of State,"In his second novel, Matthew Palmer plunges into the murky world of Washington consulting firms full of former insiders who have trouble giving up their stock in power and influence. The story revolves around suspicions of fake intelligence manufactured to provoke India and Pakistan to up their nuclear rivalry. Conspiracy theorists will enjoy the shadowy world of The Stoics, a secret group of government bureaucrats who are determined to reshape the world by circumventing official policy. The story is so captivating you can't help but wonder if it might be slightly plausible.","[staff-picks, mysteries-and-thrillers, the-dark-side]",0399165711,9780399165719
Steven Lee Myers,The New Tsar: The Rise And Reign Of Vladimir Putin,"If you are perplexed and intrigued by the enigmatic Vladimir Putin, you'll want to read this biography. Steven Lee Myers goes behind and beyond the stereotypes of a workaholic leader driven by the humiliation and chaos of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Reserved and suspicious by nature, Putin is determined to project Russia as a great power and to unify the country with him at its center. His motivations — for everything from hosting the Olympics to getting involved in Ukraine and Syria — are a lot clearer thanks to Myers' detailed reporting.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, nonfiction, rather-long, tales-from-around-the-world]",0307961613,9780307961617
David McCullough,The Wright Brothers,"Most school kids know that Wilbur and Orville Wright were the first to fly a mechanized plane, but the brothers' story is so much more than that simple fact, as David McCullough lays out in his typical crisp and compelling style. Wilbur and Orville were an unlikely pair, complementing each other at every stage and thriving in their insular world. McCullough also explores their sister Katharine's instrumental contributions to their success, and explains how she, too, took to the skies. More than a century later, the Wright family trials and successes are as captivating as if they had taken place last year.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, eye-opening-reads, family-matters, for-history-lovers, nonfiction]",1476728747,9781476728742
Chinelo Okparanta,Under The Udala Trees,Ijeoma is a young girl growing up in the difficult years following Nigeria's 1967 Biafran War. But coming of age in a war-torn country isn't her only challenge: She's also struggling to balance her taboo same-sex relationship with her mother's (and her society's) expectations. Chinelo Okparanta's writing is so immersive that even readers who have nothing in common with Ijeoma will feel like they've lived her experience. I couldn't put the book down and even pulled an all-nighter to finish it (then was a zombie at work the next day).

"Maryrose Wood, illustrated by Eliza Wheeler",The Unmapped Sea,"I never counted the months to a book's publication until I finished listening to Book IV of the <em>Incorrigible Children of Ashton Place</em> series and howled for more. It's a droll, fantastic tale of children who were raised by wolves and are guided through danger and artistic development by their sensible and endearing teenage governess, Penelope. Their invented phrases (like ""optoomuchstic"": hopeful in that way that sets the stage for perilous disappointment) have made it into my family's everyday conversation. With its spent children ""draped over the furniture, limp as empty coats"" and ominous encounters with beet nobility, finishing <em>The Unmapped Sea</em> left me counting the months once again.

Michael Wolff,Television Is The New Television: The Unexpected Triumph Of Old Media In The Digital Age,"Only a world-class iconoclast would take on media's biggest slab of conventional wisdom: that television will soon be killed by digital platforms. But media columnist and author Michael Wolff — whose enemies list is so long, he fills the book's back page with insults from <em>The New York Times</em> and Gawker — is just that pot-stirrer. His book argues that our love for shiny new concepts has blinded us to a simple fact: TV keeps making money while digital media still traffic in pennies, comparatively. And instead of replacing television, digital video outlets like Netflix, Amazon and YouTube are becoming more like TV. Wolff makes his case with the kind of detail only media nerds will read to the end, but his argument is a great way to stop conversation the next time someone tells you your TV is headed for history's dustbin.","[staff-picks, eye-opening-reads, nonfiction]",159184813X,9781591848134

What separates Brookes from many others in the genre is that he knows his subject, China, intimately. (Full disclosure: The author and I were colleagues when he served as a BBC correspondent in Beijing in the 1990s.) Brookes has ripped the plot of <em>Spy Games</em> from the headlines of a real-life Communist Party power struggle and set it in London, Ethiopia, Hong Kong and a Chinese casino in the jungles of Myanmar.

It's an intimate, generous and insightful reflection on Sacks' full and varied life: the shock of his mother's rejection when she learned he was gay; his forays into weightlifting, fast motorcycles and drugs; his exceptional career as neurologist and writer; his late-life experience of love in his 70s; and, always, his curiosity and empathy for others.

Helen Castor spends the first 89 pages of this biography setting up a world of blood and betrayal before Joan even makes her entrance. When the maid finally wades into this political snake pit, her power to  move hearts and armies is both mysterious and astonishing. Castor never goes beyond the bounds of the documents and never succumbs to the modern impulse to psychoanalyze her heroine. As a result, this Joan is a creature of her time: used, destroyed and sanctified to serve the aims of the powerful.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, ladies-first, nonfiction, tales-from-around-the-world]",0062384392,9780062384393

Through 143 pages, she tells overlapping stories centered on her romance with the gender-fluid artist Harry Dodge and her own pregnancy. She writes in a long, unbroken sequence of short paragraphs into which she weaves quotes and theories by philosophers, child psychologists, artists, critics and loved ones. <em>The Argonauts</em> is Nelson's running log of joy and fear in a time of transition — the never-ending voyage of making a family without a map.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, family-matters, for-art-lovers, ladies-first, love-stories, nonfiction, rather-short, seriously-great-writing]",1555977073,9781555977078
Elisa Albert,After Birth,"Elisa Albert's take on birth, motherhood and female relationships is the antithesis of the treacly cliches that so often surround these well-trod subjects. Her story is messy, devastating and raw — deeply felt and deftly told. Through the experience of Ari, a hard-core feminist party girl/academic, Albert explores the most difficult part of becoming a mother: the eclipsing of your identity and relationships, and the struggle to find your footing in a completely new world. It will leave you marveling at the power women have to survive, to break each other's hearts and, when we're lucky, to rescue one another.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, eye-opening-reads, family-matters, ladies-first, realistic-fiction]",0544273737,9780544273733

Sophie Straw is a Lucille Ball devotee and small-town beauty queen who moves to London and lands the lead role in a BBC sitcom. But this isn't just Sophie's story; Hornby lovingly creates an ensemble of writers, producers and actors trying to make light entertainment during the turbulent 1960s. <em>Funny Girl</em> explores the roles of highbrow and lowbrow entertainment, and what it means when art imitates life. The result is a charming, sweet book that's not at all as fluffy as the sitcom at its center.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, historical-fiction, realistic-fiction, tales-from-around-the-world]",1594205418,9781594205415

It also helps when the writer is Wil Haygood, who has a knack for injecting drama and spark into legal and legislative proceedings.

So whether you need to know what size rug will work best in your space or how to infuse your home with comfort and charm, <em>Habitat</em> can help.

Tim Johnston,Descent: A Novel,"This was the first book I read in 2015, and it was also my favorite. When 18-year-old Caitlin goes missing on a family vacation in the Rocky Mountains, her stoic father stays behind, always looking. An unlikable character will surprise you, and there's an ascent — a drive up, up into the mountains through snow-covered switchback turns — that is excruciatingly satisfying. Long after another big 2015 thriller, <em>The Girl On The Train,</em> evaporated from my reading brain, I am still thinking about <em>Descent.</em>","[staff-picks, family-matters, mysteries-and-thrillers, realistic-fiction, the-dark-side]",1616203048,9781616203047
Amy Stewart,Girl Waits With Gun,"I don't particularly like to laugh when I read — I'd happily have my nose in a crime book at all times — but I read this entire novel with a smile on my face. Amy Stewart resurrects a very real heroine from history: In 1914 New Jersey, Constance Kopp dared to pursue justice for herself and her sisters after their horse buggy was hit by a car. The adventures that follow set Constance on a path to becoming one of the first female deputy sheriffs in the U.S. And how I smiled when I found out this is the first of a trilogy!","[staff-picks, family-matters, historical-fiction, ladies-first, realistic-fiction]",0544409914,9780544409910
Ruth Ware,"In A Dark, Dark Wood","At home sick with a brain-numbing flu bearing down, I was unable to put this book down. A crime writer wakes with amnesia and the sinking feeling that she has done something bad. Then the story shifts to a group of 20-somethings gathered in a remote English country home for a ""hen,"" or bachelorette, party. There is murder, and there are also delightful tips of the pen to Agatha Christie. You will probably sniff out who is to blame, but only when you're within striking distance of the end — and in no way will that spoil the fun.","[staff-picks, ladies-first, mysteries-and-thrillers, tales-from-around-the-world, the-dark-side]",1501112317,9781501112317

Robin Givhan,The Battle Of Versailles: The Night American Fashion Stumbled Into The Spotlight And Made History,"You know that cliche about history ""coming alive""? Well, in the hands of Pulitzer Prize-winning fashion critic Robin Givhan, it does. On a chilly November night back in 1973, five American designers went toe-to-toe and dress-to-dress with five French designers in one legendary fashion show. It was seemingly a fundraiser for the restoration of the Palace of Versailles, but lift the hemline just a smidge and you'll see that there was so much more at play — race, gender, the new world pushing up against the old. If you're tempted to dismiss this as simply fashion history — don't.","[staff-picks, eye-opening-reads, for-art-lovers, for-history-lovers, nonfiction, tales-from-around-the-world]",1250052904,9781250052902

I began to imagine him standing before a giant bulletin board of timelines, maps and character bios — like a puppeteer moving everything into place exactly as he wanted it. The book covers a vast swath of Russian history, from 1930s Leningrad to modern day, and it's simultaneously tragic, absurd and poignant. The last story is his only overreach, but it doesn't matter.

In warm, conversational tones, the famed composer of <em>Einstein on the Beach</em> unspools his remarkable life, from working in his father's Baltimore record shop to discovering his personal brand of minimalism (""process replaced narrative"") to his enlightened studies with Ravi Shankar.

Each Iremonger is assigned a ""birth-object"" that must never leave his or her person: Clodius Iremonger, for instance, has a bath plug, while his betrothed, Pinalippy, has a doily, and so on. Beginning with the mystery of why Clod can hear birth-objects speaking names, each volume expands into the next like nesting dolls: <em>Heap House</em> grows into <em>Foulsham</em> which grows into <em>Lungdon</em>, house to borough to city.

Once your seat belt is fastened, Kovaly takes you on a ride as thrilling for its literary mastery as for its bleak mystery. Caveat lector: You may find the end unsatisfying.

In this final volume his occasional departures from reality, as when he apparently has a mental breakdown from overwork, add an unsettling but fascinating note. Mizuki's sketches of Japan and New Guinea, with his patented blend of clashing styles, are piquant and engaging throughout.","[biography-and-memoir, comics-and-graphic-novels, for-history-lovers, identity-and-culture, nonfiction, rather-long, tales-from-around-the-world]",1770462015,9781770462014
Riad Sattouf,"The Arab Of The Future: A Childhood In The Middle East, 1978-1984: A Graphic Memoir","Riad Sattouf's pen frisks and wiggles, but his drawings and his message are more complex than they appear. Telling of his childhood in Libya, Syria and France in the early 1980s, Sattouf — a former contributor to the French humor magazine <em>Charlie Hebdo</em> — denounces pan-Arabism and Islamic politics. This graphic memoir has been compared to <em>Persepolis</em>, Marjane Satrapi's graphic novel about growing up in Iran. In fact, it's a kind of anti-<em>Persepolis</em> in its icy cynicism.","[biography-and-memoir, book-club-ideas, comics-and-graphic-novels, family-matters, identity-and-culture, nonfiction, tales-from-around-the-world]",1627793445,9781627793445
Jennifer Hayden,The Story Of My Tits,"Life surges and flows, unstoppable, in Jennifer Hayden's graphical autobiography. It may be organized around Hayden's experience of having breasts and losing them to cancer, but it's far more than just a record of the existence of two bumps of flesh. It's also a rebuttal to the forces of illness and early death. Hayden shouts back with everything she has. Placed alongside dozens of other experiences in this long book, cancer isn't allowed to shove joy, hope and humor offstage.","[biography-and-memoir, comics-and-graphic-novels, family-matters, ladies-first, nonfiction]",1603090541,9781603090544
Sydney Padua,The Thrilling Adventures Of Lovelace And Babbage: The (Mostly) True Story Of The First Computer,"With her look at the first computer, Sydney Padua transforms punch cards and little brass cogs into the stuff of legend. Her Victorian heroes are nothing if not memorable: The larger-than-life computational genius Charles Babbage, Padua writes, was a ""blend of Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Toad, Don Quixote and Leonardo da Vinci."" The once-overlooked, eccentric math whiz Ada Lovelace smokes a pipe and scribbles equations. Padua's exaggerated, loopy drawing style keeps the energy high. Her characters gasp and glower and grin; their hair ruffles in the steam.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, historical-fiction, its-all-geek-to-me, ladies-first]",0307908275,9780307908278

The first installment of Ann Leckie's trilogy opened a world; by now, things are so complicated for protagonist Breq that all you can hope for is to be satisfied. Luckily, <em>Mercy</em> delivers.

As thoughtful as they are wondrous, these tales run the gamut: epic and domestic, charming and chilling, realistic and magical, with prose like a jewel box. If it looks scholarly at first glance, take heart; by the time God folds up the desert to help a lost heroine find her way across a strange land, this collection will have made itself at home in your imagination.","[for-history-lovers, poetry, science-fiction-and-fantasy, tales-from-around-the-world]",0141395036,9780141395036

This novel — about a girl who isn't quite her, working in a factory and going to school in the 1970s — is framed with the modern life of ""the author,"" in a time and place she haunts more than really lives in. Until her youth is laid out and the truth told, she's trapped in echoes of life: negotiating family in the past, staring at an unfinished manuscript in the future. It's a story of the pasts that build us, and it makes for one of the most absorbing reads of the year.","[family-matters, historical-fiction, identity-and-culture, tales-from-around-the-world]",1605988634,9781605988634

The tales (translated by Maria Tatar) are fascinating — free of bowdlerized retellings, they have all their original, fiercely oddball appeal. Some are echoes of familiar stories and some are new and occasionally bizarre, but all are alive with personality (lazy flax-harvesting maidens beware).

David Jaher,"The Witch Of Lime Street: Séance, Seduction, And Houdini In The Spirit World","Occasionally, you run across a book so good it feels like a secret — and spend months recommending it to anyone who will listen. That's <em>The Witch of Lime Street.</em> David Jaher's sprawling history follows <em>Scientific American</em> magazine's search for a genuine medium in the 1920s. It was a perfect storm of editorial egos, scientific rigor and Spiritualist popularity — and a road that would lead to Boston and a woman ready to face the great debunker, Harry Houdini himself. The research is painstaking, but it reads like a thriller, threading in enough uncertainty that we never lose a sense of dangerous magic.

Jeff Lemire's main character, an android programmed to be a human child's companion, radiates emotional warmth in a cold and dangerous universe beset by warring pro- and anti-robot factions. It's a nuanced, thoughtful yet propulsive read that's buoyed by Nguyen's ghostly watercolors, which imbue even the bulkiest piece of future-tech with an uncanny layer of menace.","[staff-picks, comics-and-graphic-novels, science-fiction-and-fantasy]",1632154269,9781632154262
Adrian Tomine,Killing And Dying,"The six short stories of <em>Killing and Dying</em> fit squarely in the genre of Comics About People Being Horrible To Each Other dominated by such virtuosos of alienation as Chris Ware and Daniel Clowes. With surgical precision, Adrian Tomine dissects the everyday conflicts and unhealthy patterns that engulf couples and families: A would-be artist lashes out at his patient wife; a father grapples with his daughter's embarrassing attempts at stand-up comedy; an alcoholic woman falls in with a man she knows she should not. Yet there's nothing clinical about the empathy Tomine feels for his characters or the specificity of detail in his art; together, they create a world the reader cannot merely observe from a safe remove — a world so unsettlingly familiar it can't help but implicate us, and pull us in.","[staff-picks, comics-and-graphic-novels, family-matters, the-dark-side]",1770462090,9781770462090

These and many other strips from Reza Farazmand's popular Web comic fill this dryly absurdist collection, accompanied by new prose pieces so hilariously deadpan that rigor mortis sets in.

But then, Tamaki's never been one to lunge sweatily for a punch line; she's much more interested in mood and character, and if she happens to find a joke along the way: bonus. As a result, the collected strip reads like a discursive (and deeply sardonic) YA novel in which characters discover themselves at the same gradual pace readers do.","[staff-picks, comics-and-graphic-novels, science-fiction-and-fantasy, young-adult]",1770461981,9781770461987

She's Squirrel Girl, plucked from Marvel Comics' deep bench to star in her own solo series, which finds her (and trusty squirrel sidekick Tippy-Toe) navigating new relationships and sundry secret identity shenanigans on her college campus.

Mary Norris,Between You & Me: Confessions Of A Comma Queen,"<em>Between You and Me</em> is part memoir, part guide to the mind-bending nuances of English grammar, part homage to <em>The New Yorker</em> — where Mary Norris has spent more than 20 years as a highly specialized proofreader — and completely delightful. It brims with wit, personality and commas. Norris is a stickler who can't resist shtick. She pounces gleefully on typos and is as passionate about sharp pencils — soft graphite Palomina Blackwing 602 pencils, to be specific — as she is about sharp writing. Despite her insistence on maintaining grammatical standards, a prim and regal comma queen she is not. In fact, she is vociferous in her defense of judiciously deployed profanity — which adds punch to her explanation of why ""between you and I,"" in trying to be ""so [bleep]ing polite,"" is just wrong, wrong, wrong.","[biography-and-memoir, funny-stuff, its-all-geek-to-me, nonfiction]",0393240185,9780393240184

Yes, the title is mawkish and the sensational setup feels like the stuff of tabloids. But the novel, shifting between various survivors, shines as it sifts through everything that went up in smoke that night to reveal what actually happened. It also salvages the solace and hope to be found in connecting with others.","[book-club-ideas, family-matters, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side]",1476798176,9781476798172
Jane Smiley,Golden Age: A Novel,"Jane Smiley's expansive, cumulatively addictive ""Last Hundred Years"" trilogy plows through a century of American history and social change as it follows an Iowa farm family from 1920-2019. The Langdons disperse across the country, fight wars overseas, serve in Congress, make and lose bundles on Wall Street, marry and divorce, and suffer the effects of extreme weather. The trilogy's power lies in the unfolding lives of a Russian novel's worth of characters who breed and hybridize in unpredictable ways — yet still share a connection, however eroded, to their agrarian roots. <em>Golden Age</em>, with its many deaths and its emphasis on the alarming, far-reaching impact of climate change, leaves some surviving characters wondering whether the golden age is perhaps behind them.

Obviously not wired for the retiring life, she threw herself into writing <em>My Kitchen Year</em>, an unabashedly sentimental memoir about the restorative solace of cooking and the redemptive power of ""finding joy in ordinary things."" But even better, it's a collection of 136 recipes, mostly comfort food and the stuff of cravings. She's as refreshingly assertive in her opinions as she is in her taste for bold spices like sriracha. For example, about her favorite waffles — an elaborate yeast-raised production from Fannie Farmer — she comments, ""There are easier waffle recipes, but they're little more than pancakes with dents.""

This profoundly clever chapbook of brainy, nihilistic, dour but playful aphorisms began as work-avoiding tweets. With the stern-faced, monocled German Jewish philosopher Theodor W. Adorno as his avatar, Jarosinski riffs succinctly and brilliantly on Nietzsche, Freud, Marx, philosophy, and language as he gleefully plumbs the sinkhole of existential hopelessness. A few favorites: ""-Ologies: Are usually taut,"" and ""Telling a tale full of sound and fury: Idiot-proof. Signifying nothing: Harder than it looks."" An aphorism, he writes, is ""Philosophy's ship in literature's bottle.""

In this wry, delightful paean to some of the tiniest wonders of the natural world, he also makes a case for the opposite of globalism — cutting our overwhelming world down to size by focusing intensely on a narrow point of interest. <em>The Fly Trap</em> proves that great writing can elevate anything — including a swarm of insects.","[biography-and-memoir, book-club-ideas, eye-opening-reads, funny-stuff, its-all-geek-to-me, nonfiction, seriously-great-writing, tales-from-around-the-world]",110187015X,9781101870150

Luiselli's elastic mind comfortably wraps itself around molars, Montaigne, fortune cookies, and theories of identity and storytelling.

In it, the acclaimed science-fiction/fantasy author imagines the mysterious arrival of icebergs that levitate over London, space-elevator suicides, and meditations on time and probability. These tales explore the dark, horrific beauty hidden just beyond reality — or to quote Miéville himself in the story ""The Dowager of Bees"": ""A dense forest of might'ves.""","[poetry, science-fiction-and-fantasy, the-dark-side]",110188472X,9781101884720
Molly Tanzer,Vermilion,"Molly Tanzer's keen imagination is on display in her new novel, <em>Vermilion,</em> a work of alternative history that finds fresh magic in the mingling of fact and fantasy. In the book's wild vision of the Wild West circa 1870, ghosts linger to haunt the living. Enter Elouise ""Lou"" Merriwether, who ushers the dead to their final resting place, along the way becoming one of speculative fiction's most compelling protagonists in recent memory. <em>Vermilion</em> is a unique, thought-provoking romp that rewrites the past with a vivacious flourish.","[eye-opening-reads, historical-fiction, ladies-first, science-fiction-and-fantasy]",1939905087,9781939905086
N.K. Jemisin,The Fifth Season,"N. K. Jemisin's latest novel, <em>The Fifth Season,</em> takes place in a land called the Stillness — a tragically ironic name, since it suffers geographical cataclysms on a periodic basis. Essun, a schoolteacher whose husband inexplicably kills their son and flees with their daughter, undergoes a quest across the Stillness that starts out as a rescue but becomes something else entirely. Jemisin brilliantly illustrates that imaginative world-building is a vital element of fantasy, but also that every character can be a world unto herself.","[science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side]",0316229296,9780316229296
Paula McLain,Circling The Sun: A Novel,"As chronicled in this richly textured novel, aviator Beryl Markham's life is the stuff of legend. The narrative focuses on Markham's life through her 20s; she tells her story from the cockpit of her plane during her record-breaking Atlantic flight. Born Beryl Clutterbuck, raised in British East Africa to a neglectful mother and a racehorse-trainer father, she models fearlessness throughout her life. At the heart of the story is Markham's romantic liaison with the iconic big-game-hunter Denys Finch Hatton (of <em>Out of Africa</em> fame). Paula McLain has created a voice that is lush and intricate to evoke a character who is enviably brave and independent.","[book-club-ideas, historical-fiction, ladies-first, realistic-fiction, tales-from-around-the-world]",0345534182,9780345534187
Stephen Jarvis,Death And Mr. Pickwick: A Novel,"<em>The Pickwick Papers</em>, serialized in 1836, made Charles Dickens — then writing under the pen name ""Boz"" — famous. The illustrator of the work was a then-well-known caricaturist named Robert Seymour. Stephen Jarvis' debut novel dramatizes the origin story of <em>The Pickwick Papers</em>, bringing Dickens and Seymour alive in rollicking scenes of early 19th century England. Driving the narrative are the circumstances of Seymour's spark of an idea for <em>Pickwick</em>, his shocking suicide and Dickens' later claim of authorship. In the end, though, Jarvis' arguments about who concocted the book seem less important than the Dickensian/Seymourian atmosphere he creates.","[eye-opening-reads, historical-fiction, rather-long, realistic-fiction]",0374139660,9780374139667
Alice Hoffman,The Marriage Of Opposites,"Alice Hoffman's brilliant paint box of a book is set in the early 1800s in the town of Charlotte Amalie, on the island of St. Thomas. Here we meet the family of Camille Pissarro — the Impressionist painter who will soon rise to fame — starting with his mother, Rachel. (Camille is her favorite son.) As in Hoffman's previous work, this book is rich with magical realism. There's a busy panoply of characters, aunts and cousins and random stepfathers. Forbidden marriages abound. And underlying the relationships is a lavish Caribbean canvas: The parrots in the trees, the coconut cake, the scent of jasmine.","[book-club-ideas, family-matters, for-art-lovers, historical-fiction, realistic-fiction, tales-from-around-the-world]",1451693591,9781451693591
Aislinn Hunter,The World Before Us: A Novel,"A gaggle of querulous ghosts narrates the events in this novel by Aislinn Hunter, who brings a moody grace to the phantoms and to her telling of this quirky tale. Protagonist Jane works as an archivist at an eccentric, musty museum, and on the side she investigates the 1877 disappearance of a girl in the English countryside. The twist: As a teen, Jane's 5-year-old charge went missing in these same woods. Ghost-story tropes abound, from a spooky abandoned asylum to a haunted country house, and at the center is a brutal, long-buried crime.

Translated by Ellie Robins, the novel delves into the troubled political and economic history of Argentina. As great stories often do, it begins with a body, that of a steel company executive who is sent to deliver an attache case full of money but dies in a helicopter crash. Was this event an accident or a planned execution? The unnamed narrator asks these questions while also weaving in stories concerning his personal history with money and how it complicates our lives.

Translated by David Frye, these linked stories craft a picture of a dystopian future: Aliens called xenoids have invaded planet Earth, and people are looking to flee the economically and socially bankrupt remains of human civilization.

He finds the foundations for his most enthralling work in the complex ties between fathers and sons, nations and their people, and, especially, hapless lovers. To read Zambra and a collection like <em>My Documents</em> is to engage with someone who writes as though the burden of history was upon him and no one else — the history of his country of Chile, of literature and of humanity's shared experience. Put simply, the novel is a force, and further proof that the author is in a class of his own.","[family-matters, poetry, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing, tales-from-around-the-world]",1940450527,9781940450520

Stories like ""The Escape"" and ""Daydream and Drunkenness of a Young Lady"" — which deals with a discontented housewife on the brink of insanity — stay with you like a kind of dream. These 85 stories, some only a few pages long, reaffirm Lispector's singularity and her reputation as ""the great witch of Brazilian literature.""

First published in 1970, and translated from the Russian for the first time by Josh Billings, the novel follows police inspector Peter Glebsky, a family man anticipating his first vacation in years. Shortly after he arrives at his inn, however, strange events begin to unfold, and Glebsky realizes his vacation will be anything but relaxing.

"Alejandro Jodorowsky, translated by Alfred MacAdam",Where The Bird Sings Best,"<em>Where the Bird Sings Best</em> is Alejandro Jodorowsky's brilliant, mad and unpredictable semi-autobiographical novel. Translated by Alfred MacAdam, this multigenerational chronicle introduces a host of memorable characters, from a dwarf prostitute and a floating ghost-Rabbi to a lion tamer who eats raw meat and teaches his beasts to jump through flaming hoops. Fantastical elements aside, <em>Where the Bird Sings Best</em> is a fiercely original immigration tale that culminates in the author's birth in Chile in 1929 — a complicated time in that nation's history. Combine that with poetry, tarot and Jewish mysticism and you have a genius's surreal vision brought to life.","[family-matters, historical-fiction, science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing, tales-from-around-the-world, the-dark-side]",1632060280,9781632060280

Snow White's prince harbors a fetish for ogling his beloved in deathlike sleep — a scenario he asks her to re-enact over and over again. The most human and heartbreaking character you'll encounter is classically one of the more odious ones: Rumpelstiltskin, who desperately wants a child of his own. And the witch from Hansel and Gretel?

Brownstein proves to be a funny, elegant writer, and her book is wholly original.

Anne-Marie Slaughter,Unfinished Business: Women Men Work Family,"Anne Marie Slaughter has spent the bulk of her career thinking about matters of war and peace, national security and diplomacy and everything else wrapped up in the world of foreign policy. But in 2012, the former dean of Princeton's School of International Affairs waded into the cultural debate about work/life balance with an article in <em>The Atlantic</em> called ""Why Women Still Can't Have it All."" In <em>Unfinished Business,</em> Slaughter fleshes out a broader argument about why women and men are not given the support they need to pursue meaningful work and raise families. What makes this book so compelling is the shifting perspective between Slaughter and her husband, Andrew Moravcsik, who for several years has been the ""lead parent"" in their family. It's a must-read for any working couple trying to find the time to be good employees, good parents and — oh yeah — good partners to each other.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, eye-opening-reads, family-matters, ladies-first, nonfiction]",0812994566,9780812994568

Shirley Jackson,"Let Me Tell You: New Stories, Essays, And Other Writings","""The Lottery"" author Shirley Jackson died in 1965, so it's surprising to see new, uncollected material still coming to light. Even more surprising: Much of this material is marvelous. It ranges from comic essays that reveal Jackson's playful, even ridiculous side to powerful stories fit for the classics shelf. <em>Let Me Tell You</em> is unmistakably an attic-clearing anthology, packing together odds and sods like an unfinished character sketch and a Dr. Seuss review. But the best material is revelatory, revealing again how Jackson drew indelible characters with a few sparse words, then sent them off on wild adventures.","[funny-stuff, ladies-first, poetry, realistic-fiction, science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing]",0812997662,9780812997668
Michelle Falkoff,Playlist For The Dead,"2015 was a banner year for realism-based drama in young adult novels. The post-apocalyptic dystopias of the <em>Hunger Games</em> era have largely given way to personal apocalypses, and <em>Playlist For The Dead</em> centers on a big one: a 15-year-old trying to understand his best friend's suicide by listening to his music. It's remarkable for its structure, which invites readers to ponder how songs like Radiohead's ""How To Disappear Completely"" or Wilco's ""How To Fight Loneliness"" would sound to a depressed, bullied outcast. But it's also touching for the conclusions Falkoff reaches, which aren't as pat and simple as the song titles.","[for-music-lovers, realistic-fiction, young-adult]",006231050X,9780062310507

So he mostly ignored it to produce the best novel he could. And for series fans, it's hard to deny that he did a memorable job, respecting Larsson's characters, then confidently expanding them. This isn't the novel Larsson would have written, but it's dense, thoughtful and compelling, with its own strong voice and its own take on Lisbeth Salander.","[mysteries-and-thrillers, the-dark-side]",0385354282,9780385354288
Terry Pratchett,The Shepherd's Crown,"The final novel in Terry Pratchett's long-running, best-selling ""Discworld"" series was clearly written as a gentle goodbye to his legions of fans, practically an instruction manual in dealing with his impending death. It begins with the death of one of his most beloved, venerable characters, but sends her off with no-nonsense respect, then firmly shows how the world copes without her. It's startlingly personal for a fantasy novel about witches and elves. But Pratchett spent decades using real-world parallels to turn his books into guidebooks on wisdom, empathy and kindness.

The author who brought baroque, morose vocabulary lessons to kids' books as Lemony Snicket usually isn't as wry and acerbic in his adult work. But he makes occasional exceptions, bringing a lightness and a sense of play to this story about an unhappy teenager who wants to be a modern pirate and her unhappy father, who has a more conventional plan for escape. Somewhere between a fable, a family drama, an issue-based YA novel and a dark comedy, <em>We Are Pirates<em> has unpredictability going for it. It glares at everywhere, then laughs at it too.","[family-matters, funny-stuff, the-dark-side]",1608196887,9781608196883

If you're the latter, you're probably aware of Garth Risk Hallberg's debut doorstop, <em>City on Fire,</em> because of the hype that surrounded its publication. Is the book worth the nearly $2 million Knopf paid for it? That's for you to decide, but I can assure you that it is certainly worth reading all 944 pages. Hallberg is incapable of writing a boring sentence, and the story, set in 1977 New York City, has multiple narrators and myriad threads — but each piece fits together so tightly, you'll actually want to read to the end to see how the whole picture develops.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, family-matters, historical-fiction, rather-long, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing]",0385353774,9780385353779

This is of course because memoir is not her first language — Smith is a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet. This book is the story of her early life, her faith and her experiences with race. It's also about her relationship with her mother and her mother's death from cancer. Smith's pain and confusion — and the process of learning to live without her mother — are all told with beauty and sensitivity.

On the journey she engages in conversations, listening, sometimes without comment. That's all it is — a series of chats, of observations — but it suddenly becomes so intensely observed that you realize you're not holding a novel; you're holding a blade. No book in 2015 ruffled me more — I found myself waking in the night to spend time with its icy-hot precision, its crisp writing, and the opportunity to hold its mirror to my own mind.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, ladies-first, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing]",0374228345,9780374228347
Jonathan Bate,Ted Hughes: The Unauthorised Life,"If poetry is humanity's answer to death, then the literary feud may be the poet's answer. One feud that may never die is between the acolytes of Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath: Plath's blame him for her suicide, while Hughes' blame mental illness. Jonathan Bate's new biography stokes the flames, bravely taking on the literary giant, while quite wisely admitting that Plath's suicide is absolutely at the heart of the man's life. But Bate's scholarship, while not quite excusing Hughes' character flaws, does a beautiful job of marrying his subject's life to his rigorous and important work. The book is as insightful and charismatic as the man himself — whichever side you believe yourself to be on.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, family-matters, for-art-lovers, for-history-lovers, nonfiction, poetry, rather-long]",0062362437,9780062362438
Jeanette Winterson,The Gap Of Time: A Novel,"Re-imagined Shakespeare is, of course, everyone's bag — I'm looking at you, Baz Luhrmann — but there's a special frisson when you marry an old play with a thoroughly modern author. Jeanette Winterson's retelling of <em>A Winter's Tale</em> shimmers with energy in a way I hope the Bard would have loved. The setting is a modern American city (which could be New Orleans). Leontes is a hedge fund manager with a fully fleshed out back story and real clues to his behavior (which are tough to find in the source material). This is a book that will appeal to any fan of a good yarn; Winterson keeps the action pumping. Even if you already know the play it's a well-told tale of modern jealousy and power.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, family-matters, for-art-lovers, tales-from-around-the-world]",0804141355,9780804141352

Geraldine Brooks has retold the story of David, giving a fuller look at stories that might have made you raise your eyebrows as written: the friendship between Yonatan and David, the seduction of Batsheva, the relationship with Avigail. A fight between David and Mikhal, one of David's wives, positively sings with an anger and bitterness any woman might recognize in a fight for agency.

Ali Benjamin's beautiful debut also deals in death and somehow feels both familiar and innovative. The broad strokes: Suzy's best friend, Franny, dies while swimming in the ocean, after the girls had become estranged. Suzy craves answers — and convinces herself that a rare, poisonous jellyfish must be at fault for Franny's death. Along the way, the reader — and Suzy — learn a lot of scientific facts. But there are, of course, no good answers to why scary and sad things happen.

Her trip soon turns into an odyssey as she encounters a series of unanticipated events.

Patti Smith,M Train,"Patti Smith writes exquisitely and achingly about loss and the things that matter to her in her second memoir. Unlike the mostly chronological narrative of <em>Just Kids</em>, about her relationship with artist Robert Mapplethorpe, <em>M Train</em> is a running mental locomotive of memories and dreams, with little about her performance career. The tone is elegiac, melancholic and meditative as she evokes people who died far too young, including — most devastatingly — her husband Fred ""Sonic"" Smith and her brother Todd, both in 1994. But the book is energized by various passions, including coffee, detective shows, far-flung pilgrimages to the graves of artistic and literary touchstones, and a rundown property she bought near the beach in Far Rockaway, Queens, just weeks before Hurricane Sandy devastated the area.","[biography-and-memoir, for-music-lovers, nonfiction, seriously-great-writing]",1101875100,9781101875100
Ben Metcalf,Against The Country: A Novel,"<em>Against The Country</em> is a screed — almost the definition of one. It is a long, meandering, explosive, fierce, grating exploration and refutation of the notion that all the good in our national character comes from the rural and pastoral, and that all our manifold sins are born of town. At its most basic, it is a Southern Gothic yarn about the youth and coming of age of an unnamed narrator, growing up in a fictional version of Goochland County, Va. — a land of evil soil, terrible parents, vicious idiots, snakes, racists, genius chickens and suicidal dogs.","[eye-opening-reads, family-matters, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing]",1400062691,9781400062690
Christopher J. Yates,Black Chalk,"<em>Black Chalk</em> is a story about the fictional Pitt College at Oxford. Six students, freshers all — five Brits of varying tempers and varying levels of damage, and one American exchange student called Chad — concoct a game in a moment of boredom and inspiration. To say any more about it would be to ruin the pleasure because this book has one of the greatest surprise reveals of the year. When you see the tricky switch Christopher Yates has pulled, you just want to kiss him, because dammit if there isn't something sweet and satisfying about a plot twist pulled off with aplomb.","[mysteries-and-thrillers, realistic-fiction, tales-from-around-the-world, the-dark-side]",1250075556,9781250075550
Mary Doria Russell,Epitaph: A Novel Of The O.K. Corral,"Whatever it is you think you know about the gunfight at the OK Corral, however it is you think you feel about it, forget it all. Or don't. Maybe cling all the tighter to whatever convictions you have about what happened, who was right and who was wrong on that day, because Mary Doria Russell has 600 pages to burn a fresh understanding into you, and she uses every one of them. Needs every one of them, too, because like I said, whatever it is you think you know about what happened at the OK Corral, you're probably wrong.","[historical-fiction, rather-long, realistic-fiction]",0062198769,9780062198761
Claire Vaye Watkins,Gold Fame Citrus: A Novel,"The prose is stunning in this beautiful, meditative exploration of tomorrow's likeliest nightmare. That's when Claire Vaye Watkins has set her new dystopia du jour novel, <em>Gold Fame Citrus:</em> just over a too-near horizon where everything in the American West is drought and lack and death. Where the water is gone and the people are gone and the Southwest has become a wild, weird, rolling apocalypse that, sure, is a fiction today but might be history by next year.","[book-club-ideas, science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side]",1594634238,9781594634239
Pierce Brown,Golden Son: Book II Of The Red Rising Trilogy,"Last year Pierce Brown wrote a book called <em>Red Rising</em> that was like <em>The Hunger Games</em> with real blood under its nails. The second novel in his trilogy is like a space opera in the best possible way, full of ships and ray guns and rocket boots. It's kind of a YA series (in that the protagonist begins in his teens), but owing to some wild streak of honesty, Brown writes characters who actually behave like the murderous, entitled, terrified, insane, bestial kids they are. Brown's command of plot (and director's eye for dramatic, explode-y set pieces) keep the story surging forward, and the path he carves across space, the moon and Mars is bloody in the extreme.","[rather-long, science-fiction-and-fantasy, the-dark-side]",0345539834,9780345539830
Neal Stephenson,Seveneves: A Novel,"In the first line of Neal Stephenson's newest epic, <em>Seveneves,</em> he goes old-school mad scientist and <em>blows up the moon.</em> Then he spends 900 pages tracking what that one moment means for the following 5,000 years of human history. Though at times dry and overly technical (you will never again be the fella at the party who knows the least about Soviet spacesuit design), Stephenson is writing a true hard sci-fi novel here. His science is thrillingly merciless, and he makes life and death in space about actual life and death — about the million things that will kill you and the two or three things that really smart people can do to stay alive.","[its-all-geek-to-me, rather-long, realistic-fiction, science-fiction-and-fantasy]",0062190377,9780062190376
David Mitchell,Slade House: A Novel,"""Beautifully twisty"" is pretty much David Mitchell's trademark, and <em>Slade House</em> does nothing to tarnish his rep. It's a horror novel (which is something you just don't see that much anymore) that covers the years 1979 to 2015, told with shifting main characters. And while there may be a bit of goofiness living at its heart, it's still a worthy read simply because Mitchell is very aware of every trick he's lifting from a thousand scary stories come before, and so are his characters — each one being just as jaded, just as suspicious and just as disbelieving of all this nonsense as we are. Right up until they realize that the trap has been sprung on them, too.","[science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side]",0812998685,9780812998689
Dean Bakopolous,Summerlong: A Novel,"<em>Summerlong</em> is the story of a marriage disintegrating. Of youth fading. Of a single, hot summer in a small college town in Iowa and how it destroys the lives of a local real estate agent, a frustrated novelist, a floundering actor and a grieving young woman. It's a sharply observed and smartly written book, but it's also one that's haunted by death and sorrow and the terrible heartbreak of growing old. It captures the that instant of perfect equilibrium, where everything is exactly right — when love and family and career have come into exquisite balance. And then the instant <em>after</em>  when everything you thought you've built just falls to pieces.","[family-matters, lets-talk-about-sex, love-stories, realistic-fiction, the-dark-side]",0062321161,9780062321169
Sandra Newman,The Country Of Ice Cream Star,"This remains one of the most beautiful books I have read this year — the one I champion everywhere. It's a challenging book (about rape and murder, slavery, white colonialism, religious fundamentalism, and a plague that has wiped out 80 percent of the population, leaving none behind but several generations of black children who all die before their 20th birthdays) and is written completely in a debased (but inarguably beautified) version of English, developed among isolated knots of survivors. Newman's voice is powerful, and her protagonist, Ice Cream Star, would make the perfect YA heroine if not for the fact that she is 10 times the heroine in any of the tales whose bones this one steals.","[rather-long, science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side]",0062227092,9780062227096
Mark Z. Danielewski,"The Familiar, Volume 1: One Rainy Day In May","This year the author of the cultish (and groundbreaking) <em>House Of Leaves</em> came roaring back with the first two books of his proposed 27-volume (?!?) series, <em>The Familiar.</em> It is … bonkers. Both volumes are massive, track nearly a dozen converging storylines and countless characters, and seem to be attempting to bridge the visual/linguistic gap between the novel and the graphic novel with illustrations, innovative page layouts and other tricks in the typesetter's arsenal. The second book is stronger and more polished than the first, but Danielewski has boldly marked his artistic turf with these occasionally mind-blowing artifacts of post-everything weirdness.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, eye-opening-reads, rather-long, seriously-great-writing]",0375714944,9780375714948
Paul Kingsnorth,The Wake: A Novel,"Paul Kingsnorth set out to write a long book about England during and after the Norman invasion of 1066 and to do it in a kind of invented mishmash of ancient words reset in modern syntax, though with odd spellings and very little punctuation. Or capital letters. It's crazy, but Kingsnorth did not fail in his aim. He has brought to life a drunken, wife-beating, occasionally noble, possibly psychotic and completely bloodthirsty hero, given unto him a guerrilla force of farmers turned soldiers, and let him loose in what is essentially a post-apocalyptic world nearly 1,000 years old.","[book-club-ideas, eye-opening-reads, historical-fiction, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side]",1555977170,9781555977177
Jonathan Franzen,Purity: A Novel,"Jonathan Franzen is often thought of as a comic novelist — and he certainly is that — but he's also a historical novelist, able to capture the mood of a community at a specific moment in time. In <em>Purity,</em> he turns his gaze on state surveillance, online privacy, the student loan bubble, tech culture, and feminism. At the center is Purity Tyler, a recent college graduate looking for the truth about her father. As in Franzen's previous novels, there are multiple and intertwining plots, superbly crafted scenes, and exquisitely observed moments. But it's his characters that will keep you reading: They're angry, yet frail; sensitive, yet oblivious; smart and yet wrong about so many things.","[book-club-ideas, family-matters, rather-long, realistic-fiction, the-dark-side]",0374239215,9780374239213
Tom Williams,Among The Wild Mulattos And Other Tales,"Identity, both racial and otherwise, is at the heart of nearly all the stories in <em>Among the Wild Mulattos,</em> a manic, cutting and frequently hilarious collection from Kentucky author and academic Tom Williams. He's an uncompromising writer with a fiercely original voice, and he has created one of the most unforgettable books of the year. The collection feels vital, essential, not only for the unexpected ways Williams talks about identity but for his brash, gutsy writing.","[family-matters, funny-stuff, identity-and-culture, poetry, seriously-great-writing]",1680030183,9781680030181
Lauren Holmes,Barbara The Slut And Other People,"The characters in Lauren Holmes' debut short story collection are fully, sometimes exasperatingly real, portrayed by a young writer with a great deal of charm and not a hint of pretension. The stories in this book are sometimes painful, sometimes brilliantly funny, and most often both; Holmes can find the humor in the worst situations and the tragedy in the most glorious moments. But it's her characters that carry the action — imperfect, difficult and defiantly human. In other words, they're people. Just like us.","[poetry, realistic-fiction]",1594633789,9781594633782
Kristin Hersh,"Don't Suck, Don't Die: Giving Up Vic Chesnutt","Throwing Muses frontwoman Kristin Hersh recounts the time she spent with her friend Vic Chesnutt, the indie rock legend who died in 2009 at age 45. Written mostly in the second person, it's essentially a tender, angry love letter to Chesnutt. <em>Don't Suck, Don't Die</em> is not only one of the best books of the year; it's one of the most beautiful rock memoirs ever written. Hersh is as stunningly talented an author as she is a musician, and her portrayal of Chesnutt is perfectly done.","[biography-and-memoir, for-music-lovers, nonfiction, rather-short, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side]",0292759479,9780292759473

He's interested in them as a concept, as a living, adapting exchange of ideas, as a way people can connect with one another, even across generations. Monson's latest is a breathtakingly original consideration of what it means to be a reader — or a writer, or a human being. His focus isn't books, but rather the things we find in them: notes, due date slips, scrawlings in the margins. As an essay collection, this book is magnificent; as a love letter, it's a work of overwhelming devotion and generosity.","[for-art-lovers, nonfiction, rather-short, seriously-great-writing]",1555977065,9781555977061

A programmer's wife shuns him in favor of a sentient computer he created.

Joy Williams,The Visiting Privilege: New And Collected Stories,"<em>The Visiting Privilege</em> is the rare collection that doesn't have a single piece, even a single paragraph, that's less than brilliant, and it proves that Joy Williams is quite possibly America's best living writer of short stories. She is our poet laureate of loss and mourning, but she's so much more than that — she seems to have a supernatural ability to show what makes us function as people, at our best and at our worst. And most important, she celebrates our vulnerabilities, the moments that make us so imperfect and broken and essentially human.","[poetry, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing]",1101874899,9781101874899

It's difficult to find comparisons to an author as original as Luis Alberto Urrea, but you could say that he's kind of a country-punk Lorrie Moore, compassionate but hard-edged, a kind of literary badass who still believes in love, because sometimes, there's nothing much else to believe in. <em>The Water Museum</em> is a brilliant, powerful collection, and Urrea is a master storyteller with a rock 'n' roll heart.","[poetry, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing]",0316334375,9780316334372
Anna Lyndsey,Girl In The Dark: A Memoir,"Anna Lyndsey has a slight light sensitivity that grows worse until it becomes debilitating and she finds herself living in a dark box, mummified in layers of light-protectant clothing. Her disorienting, dreamy memoir tries to capture what it feels like to live in the dark, where her personhood, her presence as a body are suddenly in question. How do you deal with a sudden, violent narrowing of life — from something that's expansive, impossibly full, to a small existence where meaning, instead of flowing in streams, must be eked out from unwilling corners? And what about identity — are you still yourself if everything you associated with your former life is impossible? In this gorgeous book, that question — is there such a thing as a stable, continuous self? — goes from being theoretical to being desperately, urgently relevant.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, ladies-first, nonfiction, seriously-great-writing]",0385539606,9780385539609

In <em>Destiny And Power,</em> the 41st president of the U.S. criticizes former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld — two key players in his son's administration. The book also describes the elder Bush's view of the war he led against Iraq. These anecdotes are based on Meacham's extensive interviews with Bush, with many others and with unique access to Bush's audio diaries. Meacham described Bush to me as a politician who would say nearly anything to attain power (e.g., ""Read my lips. No new taxes"") and then ""do the right thing,"" even if directly contradictory, once in office.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, nonfiction, rather-long]",1400067650,9781400067657
Joshua Cohen,Book Of Numbers: A Novel,"Describing Joshua Cohen's sprawling, comic, tragic new novel is not easy. I'm tempted to use an old joke, ""It's about 600 pages,"" but Cohen beat me to it. He actually uses that line in the novel. <em>Book Of Numbers</em is about a digital-age superstar, the founder of a Google-like super-search engine called Tetration. It's also about the Holocaust, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, Arabs, government surveillance of email, writers, their editors, agents and parents; also nonparents, estranged spouses, and I could go on.

Pamela Newkirk,Spectacle: The Astonishing Life Of Ota Benga,"There's just no other way to say it: <em>Spectacle: The Astonishing Life of Ota Benga</em> by Pamela Newkirk is required reading. In 1906, Ota Benga, a young man from the Congo, was put on display in a cage at the Bronx Zoo — with an orangutan. Based on years of research, Newkirk masterfully explores the circumstances that culminated in Benga's horrifying ordeal and then goes a step further to unpack the layers of racism, wealth and imperialism that made this racist spectacle possible.","[biography-and-memoir, book-club-ideas, eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, identity-and-culture, nonfiction, the-dark-side]",006220100X,9780062201003
Jennifer Clement,Widow Basquiat: A Love Story,"Jennifer Clement uses lyrical vignettes to tell the fraught story of a close friend, Suzanne Mallouk, better known to New York City's 1980s art world as the last woman Jean-Michel Basquiat loved. The tragic spectacle of Basquiat's life and art has become so notorious, it's somewhat difficult to remember he was an actual human being. Clement restores both his humanity — hurt and hurtful, brilliant and blazing — and, just as crucially, pulls Mallouk out of the art scene's shadows and into the light. To say that this is the most compelling book you'll ever encounter about Basquiat is just the beginning of the praise Clement deserves.","[biography-and-memoir, eye-opening-reads, for-art-lovers, ladies-first, love-stories, nonfiction, rather-short]",0553419919,9780553419917

It's a style that's beautifully evocative except when it's maddening (or annoying, or gross), and it gives Morse the perfect fractured voice for this postmodern tale.","[rather-short, realistic-fiction]",0316178551,9780316178556

It's a child's vision of a time not so far gone, gorgeously rendered, and attended by brief written vignettes — one man's memories of simpler, stranger, more mysterious times when he and his friends played in echo spheres and collected the castaway bits of scrap shaken off by the slow deterioration of the freighters in the ruins of their imaginary home.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, for-art-lovers, rather-short, science-fiction-and-fantasy, the-dark-side]",1624650392,9781624650390
Angela Flournoy,The Turner House,"Angela Flournoy's knockout debut is one of those books that should, by rights, be described as the Great American Novel, as it hits all the points of American life: family, real estate, money, ghosts and loss. Set mostly in Detroit during the financial crisis of 2008, the book tells the story of the 13 adult children of Francis and Viola Turner, who must decide what to do with their family house. The characters are fascinating and funny, and anyone who has played a role in the ecosystem of his family life will recognize the joys and challenges that plague the Turners. But perhaps the strongest character is Detroit itself, as it morphs from bustling modern metropolis to a potent symbol of post-industrial decline.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, family-matters, realistic-fiction]",0544303164,9780544303164

It follows the boys' adventures in the modest town of Akure, Nigeria, where they have an encounter that threatens to violently tear their close-knit family apart. Inspired by his native Nigeria and, by extension, the contradictions and marvels of Africa, Obioma is an articulate and sometimes lyrical storyteller.
