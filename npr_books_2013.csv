Scott Anderson,"Lawrence In Arabia: War, Deceit, Imperial Folly And The Making Of The Modern Middle East","<p>After covering daily news from Syria for more than two years, there are times I read history as a guide to the outcome: In the Middle East, it's bad, and Scott Anderson's book tells us why.</p>
<p>It's a group biography that weaves the stories of legendary British officer T.E. Lawrence, who played a key role in the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Turks during World War I; German Curt Prufer, who conspired with the Ottomans; Zionist agronomist Aaron Aaronsohn, who made the desert bloom; and American oil company representative William Yale, who spied for the State Department. Yale is the least accomplished character, but the hapless American gives Anderson the grist to deliver his verdict on U.S. policy then and now. Analyzing a muddled dispatch Yale sent to Washington, Anderson writes: ""He was establishing a tradition of fundamentally misreading the situation in the Middle East that his successors in the American intelligence community would rigorously maintain for the next 95 years."" This is a book about muddling and meddling. It couldn't come at a better time.</p>","[npr-staff-picks, science-and-society, for-history-lovers, rather-long, tales-from-around-the-world]",038553292X,9780385532921
Rainbow Rowell,Eleanor & Park,"<em>Eleanor & Park</em> is a book about two teenagers who fall in love. But more than that, it's about feeling lost &mdash; because of bullying, because of abuse, because of race &mdash; and feeling loved. It captures the pure, visceral thrill of a high school swoon, but it never forgets that those feelings are real and important. Rowell's willingness to portray real ugliness and real pain means that when Eleanor and Park are daring to hope for something wonderful for themselves, the stakes feel enormous. It's called a young adult book, and indeed, it's a fine thing to give a sensitive kid. But there's nothing unsophisticated or less than serious about this empathetic, beautifully rendered novel.","[npr-staff-picks, young-adult, love-stories, the-dark-side, family-matters]",1250012570,9781250012579
Daniel Woodrell,The Maid's Version: A Novel,"Daniel Woodrell is best-known for dark tales of the Ozarks (think <em>Winter's Bone</em>). This book, also set in the Ozarks, is a fictional account of an explosion and fire at a dance hall in 1929 in the town where Woodrell's family is from. Many of the characters are based on real people, including the maid who was inspired by Woodrell's own grandmother. In her version of the events that led to the fire, the rules of class that govern the town and the passion of illicit love prove to be a dangerous and deadly combination. This is a short book, but Woodrell's writing makes you want to slow down and savor a story told by a master.","[npr-staff-picks, realistic-fiction, for-history-lovers, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side, rather-short, family-matters, book-club-ideas, historical-fiction, rather-short]",0316205850,9780316205856

Ann Leckie,Ancillary Justice,"In this thrilling and complex first novel from Ann Leckie, we plunge into a world of astro-political intrigue. Our hero is on a vendetta to destroy the rulers of a colonial empire that destroyed her starship – but as we read, this typical space opera plot turns into a rich story about how imperialism transforms civilizations as well as the most private thoughts of the individuals in them. We find that our ninjalike hero is actually the fragment of a hive mind that once controlled a starship, and her mission has its roots in a political conflict that stretches back 1,000 years. Come for the page-turning action, and stay for the astonishing character development and world building that will leave you in awe.","[science-fiction-and-fantasy, its-all-geek-to-me]",031624662X,9780316246620

In his Caldecott winner, <em>Tuesday,</em> an otherwise normal day turns strange when frogs begin to fly through the air on lily pads. His latest book, <em>Mr. Wuffles,</em> is similarly surreal. At the beginning, we meet Mr. Wuffles the cat. He lives in a normal house &mdash; wood floors, striped wallpaper &mdash; but behind the radiator, a small spaceship full of little green aliens has crash-landed. Wiesner tells the story of Mr. Wuffles and the aliens without words. The illustrations are intricate and often funny, as the aliens plot to outwit the cat and escape out the window. Very young readers will pore over the pictures, and any child with a cat will never see the family pet in quite the same way again.

Finkel has covered those wars from the front lines for <em>The Washington Post,</em> but here he embeds in the suburban homes and broken families of soldiers living with the ghosts of those battles. There have been many articles about post-traumatic stress disorder and the broken state of mental health care for veterans.

Meg Wolitzer,The Interestings,"It's hard to write well about modern friendship &mdash; as hard, perhaps, as it is to nurture one. Meg Wolitzer's latest &mdash; and probably finest &mdash; follows a group of friends who meet at arts camp in upstate New York, and go on to a mixture of great successes and minor failures. The characters remain friends for the rest of their lives, and the nature of those friendships and how they ebb and flow within those successes and failures are the novel's most striking achievement. What does it mean to covet a beloved friend's accomplishment, and to really envy his success? Wolitzer writes convincingly about teenagers, and who they become as grown-ups. And she really captures that magical period where all teenagers thought they would grow up to be as special as they were the night of the school play &mdash; only to find that life is less exciting, and more interesting (ha!) than they even thought.","[realistic-fiction, rather-long, family-matters, book-club-ideas, npr-staff-picks]",1594488398,9781594488399

But Jane Franklin Mecom and her older brother were frequent correspondents, and though she didn't have her brother's education, it's undeniable that she shared his brilliance and impatience with lazy thinking. Author Jill Lepore does an admirable job of reconstructing the life of a woman who could have been doomed to obscurity -- and in learning about Jane, we learn more about Ben and the country he helped build. <em>Book of Ages</em> is an endlessly fascinating look at the sometimes tragic, always spirited life of one of early America's most interesting women.","[biography-and-memoir, for-history-lovers, eye-opening-reads, book-club-ideas, family-matters, rather-long]",0307958345,9780307958341

Mae doesn't just embrace this world; she thrives in it.

But when I saw that Elizabeth Strout had something new, I put it on my personal reading list and devoured it in every spare minute I had. <em>The Burgess Boys</em> is set in Maine and is about two brothers who are bonded by a childhood tragedy. They've each grown up and more or less recovered, but they live very separate lives, until they reluctantly go back home to help a nephew who has been accused of a hate crime. If you have difficult relations with a sibling, if you have ever wondered why a seemingly nice kid does something hurtful and mean, if you've ever had an internal struggle about new people in your neighborhood ... this book offers a gentle but clear-eyed way of thinking about those things.","[npr-staff-picks, realistic-fiction, family-matters, book-club-ideas]",1400067685,9781400067688

But no one fired my imagination like Bob Fosse, whose bumping, grinding, undulating dancers in <em>Sweet Charity,</em> <em>Pippin</em> and <em>Chicago</em> often seemed to be all elbows, shoulder rolls and cocked bowler hats. Sam Wasson's <em>Fosse</em> tells us how his early days in burlesque (he was performing on the same stage as strippers from the age of 15) informed his choreography, and why the women he cheated on &mdash; most especially his wife and muse Gwen Verdon &mdash; stuck with him as he was razzle-dazzling every skirt on Broadway and in Hollywood.

James McBride,The Good Lord Bird,"You may know the story of John Brown's unsuccessful raid on Harpers Ferry, but author James McBride's retelling of the events leading up to it is so imaginative, and at times comic, you'll race to the finish. The tale is told by a young slave from the Kansas Territory, Henry Shackleford, who's around 12 when he's freed by Brown &mdash; who mistakes him for a girl. It's an error that goes uncorrected, and Henry, dubbed ""Little Onion"" by his new companion, finds the disguise useful as he travels with Brown and his men. Onion meets more than one historical character on his journey &mdash; there's even an outlandish vignette starring a drunken Frederick Douglass. But through Onion's eyes, it's the famed abolitionist he calls ""Old Man"" who really comes alive &mdash; radical and obsessive, and ultimately doomed. </p><p><em>This book was also the winner of the 2013 National Book Award for fiction.</em></p>","[realistic-fiction, for-history-lovers, book-club-ideas, historical-fiction, npr-staff-picks, seriously-great-writing]",1594486344,9781594486340
Paul Rudnick,Gorgeous,"As a writer who knows just how much sweat goes into making even a single joke flow from the page, I can only step back in admiration when someone writes an entire book that makes me laugh my head off. <em>Gorgeous</em> is bizarre, improbable and utterly hilarious, which Paul Rudnick pulls off with the did-he-really-do-that? flair of one of the designer dresses lovingly strewn across these pages. And yet, even choking on various warm beverages did not prevent me from rooting for Becky Randle, who discovers that magically becoming the most beautiful girl in the world doesn't fix her life after all.","[young-adult, funny-stuff]",0545464269,9780545464260
Lucy Knisley,Relish: My Life In The Kitchen,"Lucy Knisley's comic memoir <em>Relish</em> contains a series of stories from her life in the culinary world interspersed with some of her favorite recipes, all of it lovingly illustrated and annotated in her bright, cartoony style. That style is key to the book's appeal, because Knisley isn't a food hipster &mdash; she's a food nerd. Which is to say: She doesn't lecture; she enthuses. <em>Relish</em> isn't an excuse to lord her expertise over others. It's a means to connect with them, to get them to understand why she loves what she loves &mdash; and, maybe, to get them to love it, too.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, cookbooks-and-food, biography-and-memoir, rather-short, funny-stuff]",1596436239,9781596436237
Isabel Greenberg,The Encyclopedia Of Early Earth: A Graphic Novel,"Not so much an encyclopedia as a compendium of funny, sad and surprisingly moving fables from the pre-history of the world, featuring capricious bird-gods, feckless shamans, daring quests and, of course, unrequited love. Isabel Greenberg's hugely imaginative and sardonically funny mythscapes intersect biblical tales at oblique angles, and her bold visual style captures everything from the most astonishing spectacle (i.e., the roiling chaos of world-creation) to the achingly small and human (i.e., a disapproving glance) with wit and expressiveness.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, love-stories, science-fiction-and-fantasy, funny-stuff, rather-short, seriously-great-writing, for-art-lovers, the-dark-side]",0316225819,9780316225816

Early in the morning on the day that she's expecting a visit from a journalist doing a ""where are they now"" story on once well-known writers, she stumbles while walking in her garden and hits her head on a concrete birdbath. After the fall (of which Amy has no recollection), her entire personality undergoes a major alteration and, as a result of the interview, she becomes the toast of literati everywhere.  Her experiences at writing conferences, academic forums, and meetings with fans are hilarious to read about but sadly all too true.

Nikki Giovanni,Chasing Utopia: A Hybrid,"At 70 years old, poet Nikki Giovanni is loved around the world for her beautiful writing about home, family and food. <em>Chasing Utopia</em> sounds existential and distant, but the title actually refers to her very real search for an exclusive &mdash; an elusive &mdash; beer. I love that she keeps some humor in the book of poetry and essays, even as she says her mother's death allowed her to dig deep into the dark parts of her past.

Brian Kimberling,Snapper,"Humor, tragedy and beautiful writing mark this series of stories chronicling events in the first three decades or so of professional bird-watcher Nathan Lochmueller's life. Here's a good example of his prose, in which Lochmueller compares the ovenbird with the Kentucky warbler: ""The Kentucky warbler is more sadistic [than the ovenbird]. She doesn't feign injury, but she leads you away from the nest until you are ankle deep in mud or rattlesnakes or both."" The cumulative effect of these stories is the realization that although we don't always get what we want, we somehow end up wanting the things we've gotten.

""IS THERE NOTHING ELSE?!"" he asks in despair. Even his diary fails to comfort him. ""Why write?"" he laments. ""Life is a cage of empty words.""

Howard Norman's memoir is organized around five events that changed him &mdash; some are public, like the death of John Lennon, but most are intensely personal, culminating in a horrifying murder/suicide that occurred in his home and his recovery from the event. I read the book almost the way I would read poetry &mdash; reading line by line, making connections, thinking about how the language laid the life bare.

Unluckily, she chokes on a piece of meat, nearly dies, and discovers that she can see ghosts. After the explosive events of the first novel, neither Rory nor her friends can go back to their old lives.

President Woodrow Wilson was a contradiction of a human being, and historians still fight over his legacy, which has always been somewhat confusing &mdash; was he a pacifist or a warmonger, a racist or an early civil rights pioneer? A. Scott Berg, to his immense credit, avoids any simplistic conclusions in his thoughtful, absorbing biography of America's 28th president. <em>Wilson</em> is a doorstop of a book, but it's also one of the most fast-paced, readable political biographies of recent times &mdash; and it's essential reading for anyone interested in 20th century American history.","[biography-and-memoir, for-history-lovers, rather-long]",0399159215,9780399159213

And two, once you've read it, you can listen to the inimitable Susan Stamberg's look back with Jong on the environment that created <em>Fear of Flying</em> and why it's still important, 40 years later. The icing on the cake? Jong's seductive alto reading from her work, and Mama Stamberg giggling over the zipless f- - -.","[realistic-fiction, love-stories, lets-talk-about-sex, for-history-lovers, eye-opening-reads, npr-staff-picks, book-club-ideas]",0805098585,9780805098587
Katherine A. Powers (editor),"Suitable Accommodations: An Autobiographical Story Of Family Life: The Letters Of J.F. Powers, 1942-1963","It's hard to talk about J.F. Powers, the Catholic writer who crafted a modern American classic with his 1962 novel, <em>Morte d'Urban,</em> without resorting to superlatives. Powers, who died in 1999, is possibly the most underappreciated fiction author of his generation, and quite likely the funniest. This collection of Powers' letters to his family and friends is addictive, delightful and alternately hilarious and heartbreaking. Edited by his daughter, journalist Katherine A. Powers, <em>Suitable Accommodations</em> is a fine introduction to the work of the greatest Minnesota writer in history.","[biography-and-memoir, for-history-lovers, rather-long]",0374268061,9780374268060
"Juan Gabriel Vasquez, translated by Anne McLean",The Sound Of Things Falling,"Law professor Antonio Yammara thinks he's indifferent to Colombia's history of drug-related violence. Then a motorcycle roars by, a stray bullet pierces his gut and the terror suppressed for a decade comes flooding in. We've seen enough morality tales about cops and dealers, victims and addicts. <em>The Sound of Things Falling</em> provides a more sophisticated pleasure: a vision of how drugs have unraveled a generation, one humble life at a time.","[realistic-fiction, tales-from-around-the-world, seriously-great-writing]",1594487480,9781594487484
Martha Ronk,Transfer Of Qualities,"Martha Ronk has been an experimental poetry darling for years, but this may indeed be her breakthrough: It's a series of prose meditations on objects found in rooms and the pressures they exert on the people going in and out of those rooms. Ronk has a cold, analytical tone that breaks suddenly and surprisingly into feeling in the oddest places. Is this poetry? Who knows, who cares &mdash; it's really, really good.","[poetry, science-and-society, seriously-great-writing]",189065082X,9781890650827
Suzanne Hayes and Loretta Nyhan,I'll Be Seeing You,"Written entirely through letters, this novel chronicles the correspondence of two very different women who help each other through the trials, triumphs and tragedies of war. Rita is a middle-aged professor's wife in Iowa with a husband and son in battle, while Glory is a young wife and mother in Massachusetts whose husband has enlisted. Despite their differences, the two develop a deep friendship, and readers are treated to an exquisitely rendered snapshot of life on the home front. A must-read for anyone even vaguely interested in the World War II era, with romance woven through the details.","[love-stories, realistic-fiction, for-history-lovers, family-matters, book-club-ideas, historical-fiction]",0778314952,9780778314950
Dash Shaw,New School,"Dash Shaw makes comics that set out to unsettle, using the unique tools the medium provides to expose discomfiting truths about relationships both familial and romantic. A proud experimentalist, Shaw often shuns tidy narrative conventions in favor of raw emotion. His striking and enigmatic graphic novel <em>New School,</em> about two brothers who find work at a massive historical theme park called Clockworld, allows him to poke at a host of ideas about foreignness, sexuality and, obliquely, the making of art. It's a masterful, gorgeous and defiantly odd work that demands close attention &mdash; and richly rewards it.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, family-matters, for-art-lovers, the-dark-side, seriously-great-writing]",1606996444,9781606996447

Marie Brennan,A Natural History Of Dragons: A Memoir By Lady Trent,"This delightful alternate history takes place in a Victorian England where naturalists are eagerly creating phylogenies of dragons. It's the memoir of a scientist whose books about dragons are the definitive works in the field. But of course, all brilliant scientists have to start somewhere, and this book chronicles how a young woman in a male-dominated world managed to talk her way into dangerous scientific expeditions, and make incredible breakthroughs in the understanding of how dragons reproduce, fly, and speciate. Though a fantasy, this novel is truly a homage to the history of science – and its brave, no-nonsense heroine will win you over with her passionate love for field research (and her love for a bookish young man, too).","[science-fiction-and-fantasy, for-history-lovers, its-all-geek-to-me, love-stories]",0765331969,9780765331960

Figures as beloved as the ""Man in Black"" present a hazard for biographers &mdash; it's easy for chronicles of their lives to turn into hagiographies. Journalist Robert Hilburn deftly avoids this trap in <em>Johnny Cash,</em> which is as fascinating as it is honest. Cash wouldn't have been who he was if it weren't for his capacity for both love and sin, and Hilburn's portrait of a genius in constant battle with his demons is as absorbing as any biography published this year.","[biography-and-memoir, for-history-lovers, rather-long, for-art-lovers]",0316194751,9780316194754

Austin Grossman,YOU,"<em>YOU</em> is a surreal, melancholy character study of a group of high school gamers who grow up to be semi-legendary videogame developers. Austin Grossman turned superheroes into socially awkward neurotics in his previous novel, <em>Soon I Will Be Invincible</em>, and here he turns game development into a dangerous, often-deadly quest. As our hero tries to find a bug in the game he is desperately trying to finish, he is also working through the senseless death of his friend, who created the first version of the game. In part, the book is a stylistic exploration of videogame writing, offering us pages of object and character descriptons just as they would be written before being converted into the code of a game. But it's also a coming-of-age story about how we never leave our fantasies behind. They become more real, and more powerful, as we age.","[science-fiction-and-fantasy, its-all-geek-to-me]",0316198536,9780316198530

In this, his third and best book, he is moved to song by the challenges, whimsies and ecstasies of fatherhood and suburban life. These poems are all kinds of tender; they're funny, too.

Her rescuer, the village doctor, seeks refuge in a barely functioning urban hospital run by a brilliant surgeon -- a still-young woman whose emotions have been stripped bare by war. These and the other characters whose lives run through this story of life in the midst of war are among the most memorable I have ever encountered.

But Dan Fagin's narrative of the arrival and explosive growth of a chemical plant in New Jersey in the 1950s weaves a complex tale of powerful industry, local politics, water rights, epidemiology, public health and cancer in a gripping, page-turning environmental thriller.

Ben Katchor sets up an intriguing tension between his rough, riotous, almost impressionistic figures and backgrounds and the voice of his captions, which enumerate salient story points with the dry, implacable plainness of a 1950s plumbing-fixture catalog. Elliptical and mysterious but never abstruse, the picture-poems of <em>Hand-Drying in America</em> celebrate the mundane world around us by revealing it to be anything but.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, rather-short, eye-opening-reads, for-art-lovers]",0307906906,9780307906908

Looking back on a long life, he recalls the pre-World War II music, movies and culture that has sustained his imagination for decades.

I think it would spoil the pleasure of the book to say more about its plot &mdash; there's a brave girl, and a special boy, and a sacrifice &mdash; but at a mere 192 pages, it begs to be read twice to enjoy the sorrow and surprise of its ending.

Marisha Pessl,Night Film: A Novel,"This big, inventive novel is about the dark secrets of a creepy film director, Stanislav Cordova, his mysterious daughter who has fallen to her death, and the investigative journalist who tries to figure out the whole story. But while it's called a novel, <em>Night Film</em> wants to be a lot more than that.

Julian Barnes,Levels Of Life,"""You put together two things that have not been put together before. And the world is changed."" In this meditation on love, destiny and loss, Julian Barnes brings his not inconsiderable powers of reflection to tackle a subject that is both personal and yet undeniably universal. It begins as a story of hot air balloons, photography and love in a time of decadence and gradually develops into a profound and intimate account of his grief following the death of his wife. Visceral, exquisitely crafted, thoughtful and heartbreaking. This is an unforgettable book.","[biography-and-memoir, science-and-society, love-stories, rather-short, tales-from-around-the-world, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side, book-club-ideas]",0385350775,9780385350778
Jeanette Winterson,The Daylight Gate,"This book serves as a portal in prose, through which readers fully enter bloody, raucous England seven years after the undoing of the infamous Gunpowder Plot, when Catholic terrorists attempted to blow up the Parliament of the Protestant King James I.

Shozan Jack Haubner,Zen Confidential: Confessions Of A Wayward Monk,"I enjoy the occasional poop joke, and books about living in the moment.

The author is a cranky misanthrope who goes to a Buddhist monastery to get some big answers and continually rediscovers that mucking about in the daily grind <em>is</em> the big answer. Works for me.

How she goes from terrified student who could barely speak English to best-selling author is a gripping tale &mdash; the kind of memoir you'll find yourself talking about at dinner parties in a fever of inspiration.

Donna Tartt,The Goldfinch,"It feels like cheating to put Donna Tartt's extraordinary third novel in a ""books of the year"" list. And yet, there are few 800-page novels in the world that, immediately after finishing, I have felt the urge to pick up from the beginning again in a desperate attempt to repeat the experience. <em>The Goldfinch</em> begins with a shocking and tragic event that leaves 13-year-old Theodore Decker without a parent and in possession of a stolen Dutch masterwork. Winding its way through Manhattan, Las Vegas, Amsterdam &mdash; all dark and druggy and dreamy and bleak &mdash; <em>Goldfinch</em> is the rare novel that prompts you to read a beautiful sentence out loud even as you gobble it whole for the plot. A great big Victorian novel that is still distinctively 21st century, it's a book that practices what it preaches: great art seduces, obsesses, and yet, connects.","[realistic-fiction, rather-long, for-art-lovers, book-club-ideas, npr-staff-picks, seriously-great-writing]",0316055433,9780316055437

Jenni Fagan,The Panopticon: A Novel,"Anais Hendricks is only 15, but she's been in trouble for years. She has a serious drug habit, she's been in foster homes since birth, and she may have put a police officer in a coma. Now, she's been sent to live in the Panopticon, a social-work housing experiment for young people. All of the units face inward toward a tower full of guards, watching the inmates. And believe me, it's worth watching Anais, one of my favorite heroines of the year. The plot of <em>The Panopticon</em> is really secondary to the roller coaster of character that is Anais &mdash; her intense, first-person narration illuminates the horrors of a young woman failed again and again by the system in Scotland, but does it by suffusing the reader with her own funny, compassionate, hard-as-nails self. By the end of the book, you'll know a lot of Scottish slang, which may or may not stick with you.

Holly Black never lets you forget that vampires are, before everything else, human predators. The morning after a wild party, Tana wakes up to find everyone dead &mdash; except her infuriating ex-boyfriend and a red-eyed boy. To get her vampire-bitten ex to safety, they go on what might be the best (or the worst) road trip in YA history, straight to the heart of Coldtown &mdash; a chillingly believable mix of prison camp and old-Vegas glamour.","[young-adult, science-fiction-and-fantasy, the-dark-side]",1780621299,9781780621296

While an online dating coach yearns tragically for her colleague in a series of funny, light scenes, a more sinister story unfolds alongside.

Adrian Matejka,The Big Smoke,"Don't think poetry: think biopic. This collection is ripped from the history books, but not limited to the facts; it's suspenseful, even when we all know the ending; and part of the appeal is watching an artist inhabit a famous figure. The actor here is the poet Adrian Matejka, who masterfully plays the parts of the great African-American heavyweight Jack Johnson and his loving but brutalized women. The grim Jim Crow South, the flashy celebrity lifestyle, the shadowboxing with self-doubt &mdash; everything here drives toward Johnson's legendary Fight of the Century against white champion James Jeffries.

Blacks suspected them of sentimentality, as well as appropriating what was thought of as a more ""primitive"" culture. The white world, in turn, diagnosed ""Miss Anne"" as either a lunatic or a sexual vampire.

In one volume, a young boy joins the Boxers, who call on spirit gods to aid them in their fight against foreign interference in China. In the second volume, we see the conflict through the eyes of a young girl who renounces her Chinese name and culture to embrace Catholicism.

Grimly delivers all that, and while he's completely faithful to Shelley's text, he brings a visual style that is totally original: Frankenstein chases his creation through a trippy landscape that is by turns Victorian, modern and futuristic.

(Wiseman also wrote <em>Queen Bees And Wannabes,</em> which inspired the film <em>Mean Girls.</em>)  This book explains so many of the things boys cannot, or will not, explain for themselves.

Although I felt at times she glossed over many of the very real racial and class differences that inform the way boys are seen and treated (stop-and-frisk, anyone?)

But <em>Hitler's Furies</em> is worth reading for several reasons. This isn't the story of the more well-known murderesses of the movement &mdash; Wendy Lower's study of the women who committed horrors during the Holocaust follows the lives of 13 ordinary women and argues that they were not just swept along by a masculine, nationalistic tide but became monsters themselves. The stories are, of course, chilling &mdash; from the women who murdered from behind a desk, typing up deportation lists, to those who murdered in person, shooting children in the Jewish ghetto. But what's most harrowing is what happened to them &mdash; nothing. Only one was tried and found guilty. And if the Holocaust was perpetrated based on one ugly prejudice &mdash; anti-Semitism &mdash; these women got away with their crimes because of another &mdash; a rooted belief that women are somehow naturally more innocent.","[science-and-society, for-history-lovers, tales-from-around-the-world, eye-opening-reads, the-dark-side, npr-staff-picks]",0547863381,9780547863382

"Tanya Lee Stone, Marjorie Priceman",Who Says Women Can't Be Doctors?: The Story Of Elizabeth Blackwell,"Meet Elizabeth Blackwell, who was never particularly interested in healing or medicine (she hid herself away when she felt sick, and blood made her queasy) -- yet she became the first woman to graduate from medical school in America. It was the challenge that excited her, and even though the one school that accepted her application did it as a joke, she not only made it through the program, but graduated first in her class. Filled with humor, lively text and charming illustrations, this one could inspire many readers to challenge themselves as well. (For ages 5 to 8)","[kids-books, for-history-lovers, biography-and-memoir]",0805090487,9780805090482
"Eve Bunting, Sergio Ruzzier",Have You Seen My New Blue Socks?,"Poor Duck has lost his new blue socks. He searches through his toy box, asks various pals, like Fox (who sits beside a grapevine reading a book in a nice nod to Aesop) and the very artistic Mr. Ox, who suggests Duck check out the socks on the rocks, which sadly are more purple than blue. It is the littlest peacock whose sharp eyes find those pesky blue socks. An excellent choice for a newly minted reader, with some fine humorous touches in both the brief rhyming couplets and the somewhat Seussian watercolor illustrations. (For ages 4 to 8)",[kids-books],0547752679,9780547752679
Tim Harrington,This Little Piggy,"The classic nursery rhyme gets an exciting makeover. We all know the story of the little piggies who went to market and ate roast beef and so on ... but what about the piggies on the other foot? Those piggies were dancing, flying planes and exploring the universe! Now the original wee-weeing-all-the-way-home piggies want to do more fun stuff, too. Soon they are throwing costume parties, chewing gum and secretly becoming Super Toe, the world's greatest hero! Of course, all this activity is exhausting, so the piggies get ready for bed and go z-z-z ... all the way to sleep. Everyone's toes should have this much fun.

Petr Horacek,Animal Opposites,"A short dog (a dachshund &mdash; very short, indeed) looks up &mdash; way, way up, at a giraffe so tall you have to lift a flap to see all of him. A quiet white rabbit in the middle of an orange page stares a little apprehensively at the loud lion that pops up from behind the opposing flap. Animal opposites are presented in a fabulously fun and totally interactive way, with colorful, almost childlike illustrations. Children will learn important concepts and maybe be inspired to draw their own animals large and small, slow and fast, heavy and light. (For ages 3 to 7)",[kids-books],0763667765,9780763667764
Molly Idle,Flora And The Flamingo,"Many children (and grown-ups) dream of being able to leap and twirl and pose with the grace of a trained dancer ... or, in this case, an amazingly elegant flamingo. Flora, a plump little girl in a pink swimsuit, bathing cap and flippers, approaches the artiste with bravery and wonderful determination. Words aren't necessary (or included) as the dance commences. Flaps are lifted to show each dancer's reactions. Midway through it is obvious that the flamingo has resigned herself to teaching this strange new creature, and by the end they share an enthusiastic friendship. This book is graceful, goofy and positive on so many levels. (For ages 4 to 6)",[kids-books],1452110069,9781452110066
Christie Matheson,Tap The Magic Tree,"Who wouldn't want the opportunity to take a tree from a bare trunk to spring blossoms, to fruitful summer, to loss in autumn, to winter snow, and back to spring beginnings again? Simple instructions in spare, rhyming text encourage readers to add and subtract elements &mdash; tap once to add a leaf, touch buds to turn them into flowers, shake the tree to make the apples kerplop to the ground. Christie Matheson offers children the opportunity to help a tree grow and change throughout a year &mdash; what a powerful feeling! (For ages 4 to 8)",[kids-books],0062274457,9780062274458
"Jon Scieszka, Mac Barnett, Matthew Myers",Battle Bunny,"It should come as no surprise that the truly subversive Jon Scieszka and Mac Barnett are responsible for one of the funniest (and most problematic to librarians) children's books of the year. Young Alex wields a devastating pen as he transforms a book about the ooshy, gooshy ""Birthday Bunny"" into a book about the bloodthirsty, evil genius ""Battle Bunny,"" whose nefarious plans for destroying the world can only be stopped by one person ... Alex himself. This one has everything &mdash; Shaolin Bear and Ninja Turtle, a special Evil Plan Place (because everyone needs an Evil Plan Place. Where is yours?) and a cameo by the president of the United States, who finally learns that one determined kid with special birthday powers can beat out an evil genius bunny any day of the week. Of course, we can only hope that young readers won't be encouraged to start ... um, editing library books, because that would be bad. Very, very bad.

Lita Judge,How Big Were Dinosaurs?,"That's a good question, and the truth is, dinosaurs came in all shapes and sizes. Meet Microraptor, a deadly hunter smaller than a modern-day chicken! Some dinosaurs were the size of dogs or horses or SUVs. Of course, all the way at the other end of the scale, there was Argentinosaurus, as long as four school buses, and probably the largest animal ever to walk on land (but only a predator if you happened to be a tree). This book looks and reads like an adorable picture-book story but is filled with plenty of information, making it just right for the youngest dinosaur fans (and their grown-ups).

Steve Jenkins,"The Animal Book: A Collection Of The Fastest, Fiercest, Toughest, Cleverest, Shyest -- And Most Surprising -- Animals On Earth","Steve Jenkins has written and gorgeously illustrated more than 30 books about the natural world and shares some 300 of the most fascinating creatures &mdash; both the exotic and the everyday &mdash; in this compendium of the animal kingdom. It's basically his highlights reel. Here we meet the fastest, slowest, oldest, newest, biggest, smallest, earliest, most deadly and just plain weirdest.

Barbara Kerley,The World Is Waiting For You,"Barbara Kerley presents the natural world to children in this beautifully orchestrated book, which marries really good advice, like ""Sift. Scrape. Go on &mdash; get your hands dirty,"" with vividly realized photography (in this case, a close-up of a child's gloriously muddy hands). And the next spread shows a paleontologist discovering a fossil out in the field. The message is clear &mdash; find what you love to do as a child ... and who knows? Someday you may be able to use that experience in new and exciting ways. A multicultural cast exuberantly explores the great outdoors, with heart, soul, body and spirit. Readers will want to do the same. (For ages 4 to 8)","[kids-books, tales-from-around-the-world]",1426311141,9781426311147
Kevin Henkes,The Year Of Billy Miller,"Billy Miller is a bit of a worrier.  He worries that the bump on his head from a vacation accident may make him not smart enough for the second grade. He worries that he inadvertently insulted his new teacher. He worries that people will think him childish for calling his father Papa instead of Dad. He worries when his little sister gets glitter all over his bat cave diorama. But Billy is a lucky kid, with functional grown-ups in his life (especially Papa, who proves he has what it takes to be a good dad even when he has his own worries to deal with). It's a real-life story with plenty of humor and heart, and a family to root for. (For ages 8 to 12)","[kids-books, family-matters]",0062268120,9780062268129
Fuchsia Dunlop,Every Grain Of Rice: Simple Chinese Home Cooking,"Fuchsia Dunlop's books on Chinese cooking are authentic, accessible and fun to read. Her latest, <em>Every Grain Of Rice,</em> is sort of like a <em>Joy Of Cooking</em> for homestyle Chinese food, chock-full of delicious, simple recipes. More important, she helps you learn a new cuisine by demystifying the tools and techniques and teaching you how to stock your Chinese-friendly pantry. And because the Chinese diet is often low-meat and flavored with meaty-but-not-meat ingredients like fermented beans, it's great for vegetarians and vegans. There's no better introduction to Chinese cooking. I love this book.","[npr-staff-picks, cookbooks-and-food]",0393089045,9780393089042
Michael Paterniti,"The Telling Room: A Tale Of Love, Betrayal, Revenge, And The World's Greatest Piece Of Cheese","In the tiny Spanish village of Guzman, there are hill caves dating back to Roman times.  And in these caves, the locals built ""telling rooms,"" places to count the stored casks of wine and the cheeses -- and to tell tall tales and family stories. <em>The Telling Room</em> is Michael Paterniti's deeply personal, deliciously idiosyncratic account of his search for the legendary Paramo de Guzman cheese and the man who created it, Ambrosio Molinos.  Molinos had a marvelous story: He had created the cheese, made it a success, and then been betrayed by his best friend and business partner -- or was he?  It's a story of love, betrayal and revenge, yes -- but also a story about the power of stories to reshape reality.  And, of course, really great cheese.","[tales-from-around-the-world, cookbooks-and-food, seriously-great-writing, npr-staff-picks, book-club-ideas, biography-and-memoir]",0385337000,9780385337007
