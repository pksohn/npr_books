Mona Awad,13 Ways Of Looking At A Fat Girl: Fiction,"The title of this book might be off-putting — after all, the word ""fat"" makes people uncomfortable. We prefer euphemisms like ""chubby"" or ""big."" But novelist Mona Awad uses the word deliberately. She wants her readers to understand how a struggle with body image can take over a life. Lizzie, the fat girl of the title, is an insecure, overweight young woman who lets men take advantage of her in humiliating ways. Later we meet her as an older, thin woman, obsessed with staying fit, but big or small, happiness eludes her. Awad is a fine writer with a keen sense of black humor, which makes this often sad story more entertaining than you might expect.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, identity-and-culture, realistic-fiction]",0143128485,9780143128489
"Eric Ripert, with Veronica Chambers",32 Yolks: From My Mother's Table To Working The Line,"<em>32 Yolks</em> is as much a peek into the cutthroat restaurant world as it is a culinary tour of chef Eric Ripert's childhood and first years in the kitchen. He pays tribute to the chef who inspired him as a young boy (he fed him bowls of chocolate mousse), and recalls the first dish he ever made in a Michelin three-star restaurant — a hollandaise sauce with 32 yolks.

In <em>A Collapse of Horses,</em> nothing is reliable; love, relationships, friendships, memories and reality are deeply suspect.

Peering out the window of the apartment she now shares with her father and brother, August sees the three girls who will become her best friends, guiding her through this new world and into adolescence. Adult August narrates the book, and we know from the start that the friends have betrayed one another. But we only learn how, why and to what effect as August's memories return to haunt her.

Henson left the love of her life when he hit her, raising their son as a single mom. She earned far less than her white co-stars on movies like <em>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</em>. More a story of empowerment and persistence than a Hollywood tell-all, this book unfolds like a story told by Cookie Lyons' talented thespian sister; a down-to-earth, around the way girl explaining to contributor Denene Millner how a sister who graduated from Howard and worked as a secretary for the Pentagon became one of TV's hottest performers.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, book-club-ideas, family-matters, funny-stuff, identity-and-culture, ladies-first, nonfiction]",1501125990,9781501125997

His son and daughter-in-law must drive 500 miles across Montana for an operation — and his job is to look after the grandkids. At first glance, the characters may seem like simple 1950s and '60s stereotypes, but their pasts reveal more complex storylines. As someone who grew up in the area, I also got a kick out of Watson's depiction of Missoula, Mont., which, with its stately, tree-lined neighborhoods, was the envy of so many people who hailed from much harsher, rugged corners of Big Sky Country.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, family-matters, realistic-fiction]",1616205717,9781616205713

Thankfully, rock 'n' roll wise man Bruce Springsteen leaps past both obstacles with a bracing story that reads like extra stanzas to epic songs like ""Jungleland"" or, yes, ""Born to Run."" Springsteen dishes on the father who struggled with mental illness and never really understood him, how he sidestepped early efforts to present him as the new Bob Dylan and how a rock superstar hailed by millions as The Boss could endure his own struggles with depression. There might be a bit too much detail about '70s-era rock joints in New Jersey for casual fans, but this book sets the record straight on everything from the despair of his failed first marriage to fights over money with members of the E Street Band.

The language will make you wonder why you even bother speaking English. It is one of the most beautiful books of the year, absolutely the most grab-you-by-the-heart engaging, and so, so smart that Lavie Tidhar can scatter a hundred brilliant ideas like pennies on the ground — like he has so many of them in his pockets that he can just throw them away, leaving them for anyone to pick up.","[science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing, tales-from-around-the-world]",1616962143,9781616962142
Silvia Garcia-Moreno,Certain Dark Things,"In Mexico, local drug-dealing vampire gangs that trace their lineage back to the Aztecs clash with European newcomers — everywhere but Mexico City, where human gangs have declared a vampire-free zone. Living on the margins of this world is Domingo, a 17-year-old garbage collector with a heart of gold, whose vampire comics don't prepare him for the real thing. When he meets Atl, a vampire woman being hunted by a rival gang, he gets swept up in a whirlwind of blood debts and danger. Fast-paced and full of gorgeous characters, this is urban fantasy with emphasis on the urban: Mexico City is as much a character as the vampires.","[science-fiction-and-fantasy, tales-from-around-the-world, the-dark-side]",1250099080,9781250099082
Antonio Garcia Martinez,Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune And Random Failure In Silicon Valley,"Antonio Garcia Martinez, author of <em>Chaos Monkeys,</em> reads like a despicable human being: a misogynistic Silicon Valley elitist who lives on a sailboat, neglects his kids and embraces the tech culture he claims to reject. But (and this is the tricky part), he also reads like a philosopher and historian, the <em>exact</em> travel guide you'd want to walk you through the inner workings of Facebook. His tell-all memoir is the best writing out there on one of the world's most powerful companies. And he even manages to make the ins and outs of online advertising fascinating.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, eye-opening-reads, its-all-geek-to-me, nonfiction, rather-long, the-dark-side]",0062458191,9780062458193
Walter Mosley,Charcoal Joe: An Easy Rawlins Mystery,"I've been reading the Easy Rawlins series for so long, the character is like an old friend now. In this latest installment, Walter Mosley manages once again to make you care about this complicated and richly fleshed out character. He's on one hand a killer – but only when necessary and always reluctantly – while on the other a loving and protective dad, loyal friend and brokenhearted lover. And if none of that floats your boat, Easy solves mysteries too.","[staff-picks, mysteries-and-thrillers]",0385539207,9780385539203
Ben Katchor,Cheap Novelties: The Pleasures Of Urban Decay,"Ben Katchor's comic strips, published in various alt-weeklies as <em>Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer,</em> serve as both a serialized love letter to, and a deadpan satire of, a kind of urban experience that has faded from the world. Katchor produces a series of vignettes about tiny, out-of-the-way and vaguely impossible corners of a vanished New York City, and makes sure we feel a subtle magic simmering behind every grimy storefront and tenement fire escape. Originally published in 1991, this deluxe 25th anniversary edition has been reformatted by Katchor, and the result retains the artist's characteristically elliptical, allusive charm.","[book-club-ideas, comics-and-graphic-novels, for-art-lovers, for-history-lovers, funny-stuff]",1770462635,9781770462632
Alexander Weinstein,Children Of The New World: Stories,"Alexander Weinstein's assured and astonishing debut fiction collection, which explores how technology is changing humanity in tiny, specific and irrevocable ways, invites comparisons to the Netflix show <em>Black Mirror</em>. But where that series offers cautionary tales steeped in mordant cynicism, Weinstein's take is warm and achingly, plaintively funny. This is speculative fiction that privileges language and emotion over didactic moral lessons or tedious technical detail, and it's my favorite book of the year.","[book-club-ideas, poetry, science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing]",1250098998,9781250098993
Yasmine El Rashidi,Chronicle Of A Last Summer: A Novel Of Egypt,"Today, stories about Egypt often conjure up images of Tahrir Square protests and political unrest, but so much of Yasmine El Rashidi's novel — which documents three summers (1984, 1998 and 2014) in the life of a young Egyptian woman — is about silence. When the book's unnamed narrator asks, as a child, where her father has gone, no one will say. (He was forced to flee the government.) And later, when he returns, no one tells her why her parents are no longer living together. El Rashidi's story explores how one can be a participant <em>and</em> an observer of political change, and how so much of our politics are formed by the things we don't say in public and the questions we are afraid to ask.","[eye-opening-reads, family-matters, historical-fiction, identity-and-culture, rather-short, tales-from-around-the-world]",077043729X,9780770437299
Ann Patchett,Commonwealth,"<em>Commonwealth</em> isn't as soaring or as lush as Ann Patchett's earlier novels, but wow does it ever suck you in. This is a story of families and marriage and love and the unlikely friendship that develops between two sets of children, united in hatred of their parents. Reading it before bed the other night, I found myself laughing even as tears rolled down my cheeks, then gently closing the cover, turning to my husband and whispering, ""This book is so, so good.""","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, family-matters, realistic-fiction]",0062491792,9780062491794

A Presbyterian church geek from a moribund Pennsylvania steel town, he believed a career in law enforcement would be an opportunity to minister to those who needed it most. So how did he end up torturing Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib? This wrenching — and deeply moving — memoir provides a powerful reminder of how brutal circumstances can lead to an unexpected capacity for cruelty. It's also a chance to confront our collective national shame. <em>Consequence</em> is one of those books that should be required reading for all Americans.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, eye-opening-reads, nonfiction, the-dark-side]",1627795138,9781627795135
Robin Ha,Cook Korean! A Comic Book With Recipes,"Korean cookbooks are everywhere right now, but this one's different. Author Robin Ha is an artist and graphic novelist, and every page features a variety of ingredients having a rollicking, boisterous party on the page. There's a smiling daikon, a winking squid and even bland tofu that seems to be enjoying itself. Though each recipe relies on more or less the usual suspects — soy, sesame oil, chili paste, scallions, ginger — each has a distinct character, whether it's  japchae, soy spinach and bean sprout salad, pajeon or galbi.  Ha's protagonist (or alter ego) is a smiling young cook in traditional Korean silk formalwear with a ribbon in her hair.

Connie Willis,Crosstalk,"Connie Willis' books are intentionally and enjoyably exasperating, as characters struggle through screwball situations and endless obfuscations in search of the one bit of information they actually need. <em>Crosstalk</em> is no different, as a young woman deals with sudden, unwanted telepathy and the endless complications it brings to her job and her love life. Part romantic comedy, part exploration of why psychic ability is the worst superpower, and part metaphor for an oversharing society that's perpetually awash in a flood of distracting data from mobile devices, <em>Crosstalk</em> is a comedy about the importance of privacy and the pleasure of unplugging.","[funny-stuff, love-stories, rather-long, science-fiction-and-fantasy]",0345540670,9780345540676
Salvador Dalí,Dalí: Les Dîners De Gala,"Salvador Dalí, the great surrealist painter, didn't just create fantastical visions on canvas. He also hosted many dreamlike dinner parties — at one (we aren't making this up!) the hostess, dressed as a unicorn, bottle-fed a lion cub, and guests dined on frogs served inside satin slippers. In 1973, the artist released a lushly illustrated cookbook of recipes from these Dionysian gatherings. A collector's item long out of print, it has just been reissued. Warning: Many dishes feature ingredients likely to put off most palates — there's a whole chapter on snail and frog dishes alone. But for art lovers long entranced by Dalí, this is truly a feast for the eyes.","[staff-picks, cookbooks-and-food, for-art-lovers]",3836508761,9783836508766
Blake Crouch,Dark Matter: A Novel,"There's a moment in <em>Dark Matter</em> that made my blood run cold. That's a cliched thing to say about a thriller, granted. But that my horror stemmed from theoretical physics? Less so. The story hinges on the simple facts of Jason Dessen's life: He's married. He has a son. He's a middling college physics professor. And then one day, he's abducted, knocked unconscious and thrust into a life where he's still Jason Dessen … but everything else is different.  I ripped through this book, unable to put it down. It's a breathless journey through the laws of the universe and the human heart.

Jane Mayer,Dark Money: The Hidden History Of The Billionaires Behind The Rise Of The Radical Right,"Long before ""rigged"" elections were a daily (albeit false) refrain, Charles and David Koch, along with their octopuslike political organizations, were wielding multimillion-dollar influence from secret hotel conference rooms and clandestine bank accounts. For good or bad (and in Jane Mayer's telling, <em>more</em> than bad), the Koch brothers transformed American politics — elevating their libertarian ideology from fringe to mainstream. <em>Dark Money</em> takes you inside those back rooms and narrates — in clear, readable prose — the Koch brothers' 30-year conservative crusade.","[staff-picks, eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, nonfiction, the-dark-side]",0385535597,9780385535595

A tale of contact with an alien species that radically transforms our understanding of ourselves, our world and the laws of physics themselves, the novel sprawls across a jaw-dropping backdrop that encompasses universes and eons — a meditation on technology, progress, morality, extinction and knowledge that doubles as a cosmos-in-the-balance thriller.","[science-fiction-and-fantasy, tales-from-around-the-world]",0765377101,9780765377104

In this first book he continually changes his identity and circumstances — frequently attempting suicide — yet remains an emotionally stunted, amoral cipher. Even so, clues turn up that will eventually make all clear — if you've been paying attention. Thanks to the overarching conundrum and Shiga's sparse, cartoony style, the gore and nihilism manage to be simultaneously gloomy and cute.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, science-fiction-and-fantasy]",1626724520,9781626724525
Paul Tremblay,Disappearance At Devil's Rock,"Tommy Sanderson, a 13-year-old living with his single mother and sister just outside Boston, doesn't come home after a sleepover with his buddies. The search for him begins in Borderland, a nearby forest: specifically a place called Split Rock, a cleft boulder with a dead tree sticking out of it that the boys have begun referring to as Devil's Rock. From that simple premise, Paul Tremblay crafts an intricate, perception-rattling mystery in which nothing is as it seems — the kind of thriller that takes the simple premise of a lost child and twists it into a dizzying emotional vortex.","[family-matters, mysteries-and-thrillers, the-dark-side]",0062363263,9780062363268
"Vaunda Nelson, illustrated by Elizabeth Zunon",Don't Call Me Grandma,"A lot of children's books have a doting older relative hovering around, looking cuddly and offering cookies and hugs. <em>Don't Call Me Grandma</em> has a fully realized character who upends those stereotypes. The ""Grandma"" of the title is Great-Grandmother Nell, 96 years old, with wrinkled ""chocolaty brown"" skin, who wears pearls every day, doesn't hug and eats fish for breakfast. Nell is prickly and sometimes scary, but to her great-granddaughter, the narrator, she is also fascinating, with her crowded vanity, the glass she's always sipping out of, and the bedroom that's fit for a princess. Elizabeth Zunon's illustrations are genius — mixed media that allows some of Nell's memories to be sharper than others. There are civil rights-era photographs, a lone ticket to Alvin Ailey, an I Voted sticker. Vaunda Nelson spells out neither Nell's past, nor the message of the book, allowing readers the best ending: a conversation about what makes us who we are, and the pleasure of loving difficult people.

Dense topics, to be sure, but Michael Marder's little book of philosophy — just one installment in a multiauthor series called Object Lessons — brings levity and loving care to his topic.

Holiday retells stories of the famous and not so famous that will both inspire you and stop you in your tracks. This is a book to savor by reading it in increments so the power of the examples sinks in, leaving time for healthy reflection. If the rat race of modern life has you feeling burned out, <em>Ego is the Enemy</em> just might help you view philosophy as anything but a relic of the ancient Greeks.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, nonfiction]",1591847818,9781591847816

In this third and final volume, Cook focuses on the war years. As the president's attention shifted away from his New Deal programs, Eleanor pushed for progressive ideals like racial equality and full employment. She also grew into the role of ""First Lady of the World,"" working for refugee rescue and traveling to Blitz-ravaged London and bases in Bora Bora and Guadalcanal.

Curtis Sittenfeld,Eligible: A Modern Retelling Of Pride And Prejudice,"<em>Pride and Prejudice</em> has inspired endless adaptations, but rarely has anyone captured Austen's wry and antic spirit like Curtis Sittenfeld in <em>Eligible</em>. Sittenfeld isolates what makes Jane Austen endure (her social and moral acuity; her interest in what makes a good life), from the historical context (bonnets and balls) that so many adaptations fetishize.

Soon, though, time travel becomes less of a way to see old bands and more of a way to painfully revisit past relationships, departed relatives and buried traumas — not that it gets in the way of some serious music geekitude.

Such is the jumping-off point for author Richard Russo's return to North Bath, N.Y., a place he first wrote about over two decades ago in <em>Nobody's Fool.</em>  It's the kind of place that would be easy to dismiss as a down-on-its-luck former factory town, so what a joy to have a novelist open up the humanity, wisdom and — of course — comedy to be found there.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, family-matters, funny-stuff, rather-long, realistic-fiction]",0307454827,9780307454829

Johnston's <em>Exit, Pursued By a Bear</em> — about how head cheerleader Hermione Winters pieces her life back together after being drugged and raped at cheer camp — would be a depressing read. But despite its unflinching depiction of the real challenges faced by assault survivors, it's also warmer, more comforting and simply compelling in a way its plot summary could never capture. While assault survivors, both in fact and in fiction, often find their lives narrowed to this one designation, Johnston refuses to flatten her heroine. Instead, she insists that Hermione's joy in being thrown into the air during cheer routines, and the strength of her best friendship with co-captain Polly are just as vital to our understanding of her as the facts of her assault. By doing so, Johnston makes Hermione's story easier to survive, for both Hermione and the reader, without ever making it less true.","[book-club-ideas, family-matters, ladies-first, realistic-fiction, young-adult]",1101994584,9781101994580

She's got a real connection with middle-graders who are skirting puberty and having just as much fun with it as you did (amirite?). <em>Ghosts</em> tells the story of Cat and her little sister Maya, who've moved to the spooky and beautifully drawn Northern California town of Bahia de la Luna — it's windswept and wet and the sun rarely shines, but the ocean air is meant to help with Maya's cystic fibrosis. Maya is exuberant and outgoing despite the illness; Cat is more withdrawn and protective. Cat and Maya come face to face with two scary things: a cute boy, and some ghosts that frequent the town. What follows is a wonderful experience from panel to panel — and the rare book that doesn't talk down to middle schoolers about death.","[staff-picks, comics-and-graphic-novels, family-matters, identity-and-culture, young-adult]",0545540623,9780545540629
Robin Wasserman,Girls On Fire: A Novel,"Robin Wasserman's terrifying thriller is the story of two teenage girls, outcasts in their small western Pennsylvania town in the early 1990s. The girls' hatred of a popular classmate quickly takes a dark turn that just keeps getting darker. Wasserman's novel turns the Satanic panic of the Reagan-Bush years on its head, and the result is a novel that's terrifying, upsetting and hypnotically beautiful. There's not a false step in it, and you never want it to end, although you know it has to. It's an inferno of a book — brutally gorgeous — and you know it could explode at any time, but you can't turn away, even for a second.","[book-club-ideas, ladies-first, lets-talk-about-sex, mysteries-and-thrillers, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side]",0062415484,9780062415486

Margaret Atwood,Hag-Seed,"Margaret Atwood's best books delve deep into her characters' souls, but her funniest work is faster and broader. Her retelling of <em>The Tempest</em> is the latter: a modern farce that casts a small-town theater director as Prospero and the local bureaucrats as his usurpers. Atwood taps into <em>The Tempest</em>'s rage and grief and finds unsettling analogues for Miranda and Ariel that waver between realism and fantasy. But the book's meta humor is its lifeline. Atwood blurs the lines between the director's life and his art, turning the book into a simultaneous meditation on mourning and a lively, silly trip down the rabbit hole.","[book-club-ideas, family-matters, realistic-fiction]",0804141290,9780804141291

Throughout these ultra-short 100 (much of the poetry is fewer than six lines long), Nadler's ambient noodling is rooted in an arch sense of being-in-the-world, of floating ahistorically, free of the allusions and symbolisms made and exchanged over time.

Donna Gephart,Lily And Dunkin,"When a pair of introverted outsiders meet, their lives are about to change forever. For Lily, being herself is a battle she fears she is losing. For Dunkin, the new kid, he's barely staying afloat. Middle school is hard enough, but when you are transgender or dealing with a bipolar disorder, it can be torture. Though some scenes seem to wrap up too neatly, friendship, understanding and love are challenged in this finely nuanced novel. Donna Gephart's <em>Lily and Dunkin</em> introduces us to two kids who just want to be themselves — and when they find each other, they may just get that chance.

Rose Lerner,Listen To The Moon,"Fans of historical romance know that if there's one thing fictional England has in spades, it's dukes. But they might not be as accustomed to encountering valets. You might see one briefly, making certain a coat of claret velvet hangs just so on his master's shoulders, but as the hero, complete with romantic aspirations and dreams of his own, he's almost unheard of. That is what makes Rose Lerner's <em>Listen to the Moon</em> (and all the other books in her wonderfully grounded Lively St. Lemeston series) so special: John Toogood, valet extraordinaire, and upper housemaid Sukey Grimes are not the lovers you're used to seeing. They're expert at cleaning silk and unaccustomed to wearing it. But their love story is just as toe-curlingly delightful as that of any duke and duchess.","[for-history-lovers, historical-fiction, lets-talk-about-sex, love-stories]",161923310X,9781619233102

In the case of <em>Loner,</em> his dark and compulsively readable novel, the protagonist, David Federman –– one of those kids in high school who is known by almost no one –– unravels over the course of the narrative, and Wayne skillfully shows us every disturbing and obsessive moment. This is a close-grained look at a stalker, set against a Harvard backdrop, and the combination of true creepiness dropped into an undergraduate social setting is very effective: It's a tightly written, tensely memorable short novel.","[realistic-fiction, the-dark-side]",1501107895,9781501107894

So begins <em>Look,</em> the debut collection of poetry from Solmaz Sharif, with all the grace and ferocity of an unpinned grenade. Built upon the language of the Department of Defense's Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, Sharif's <em>Look</em> is an open invitation to marvel at the audacity and capacity of euphemism in modern politics. As she detonates term after DoD-approved term throughout tender and personal poetics, Sharif takes back wartime doublespeak by pumping it full of her own blood and memory.","[staff-picks, poetry, seriously-great-writing]",1555977448,9781555977443

I know this sounds like the plot of a teen comedy, but bear with me, because <em>Losing It</em> is one of the cleverer books about sex I've ever read. This is partly because Emma Rathbone resists, after the initial setup, making anything about her characters cliche — Julia is a delightful and sharply drawn young woman, and her observations about the world of sex and dating are both insightful and hilarious. Julia — like most of us in our '20s — makes some good decisions, and some bad ones, and in the end finds her most central relationship won't have anything to do with sex at all.","[staff-picks, family-matters, ladies-first, lets-talk-about-sex, realistic-fiction]",1594634777,9781594634772

Born in London in 1775, she traveled the world, worked tirelessly to get her husband elected and served as a behind-the-scenes advisor. Through it all, Louisa wrote; she left behind letters, plays and memoirs, documenting her trips around the world and giving an insider's view of a Congress in its infancy.

Pung's novel follows the struggles of Lucy Lam, a scholarship student trying to reckon with her Viet-Chinese heritage at a ritzy Australian private school. It feels like what Zadie Smith might produce if she set out to retell <em>Mean Girls</em>: It's funny, sharp and addictively paced, but without ever sacrificing nuance, or limiting its capacity to provoke a profound emotional response.

The entertaining, beautifully written narrative encompasses the hunt for Nazi rocket scientist Wernher von Braun during the last days of World War II, marriage to a beguiling but psychologically damaged French Holocaust survivor, and a stint in prison for attempted murder.

With no mother to visit on the 1924 Mothering Sunday holiday (when servants were given time off to visit their mothers), Jane Fairchild bikes over for a final tryst with the neighbor's ne'er-do-well son before his upcoming marriage. Their relationship, although consensual, is grossly imbalanced. The novel, a sort of slow striptease, gradually bares the contours of Jane's life before and after that fateful day. More than just a story about crossing ""impossible barriers"" like class and education at a time of seismic change in English society, it is a lovesong to ""untethered"" possibility and to finding a voice.","[lets-talk-about-sex, rather-short, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing, tales-from-around-the-world]",1101947527,9781101947524

But this is a complex relationship with dark corners — Lucy gossips amiably with her mother about people they used to know, but they never talk about the poverty and abuse that marked her childhood. Nor do they discuss the life Lucy leads now, her small successes as a writer, her husband and children.

I don't know if there's a word for that. Like schadenfreude without the guilt. The columns are autobiographical — they track Kashua, his neighbors in Jerusalem, his family and his career to form a kind of novel/memoir about a newspaper writer telling stories about being a newspaper writer and about being a Palestinian in Israel during the Arab Spring and the Israel-Gaza conflict of 2014.","[biography-and-memoir, funny-stuff, nonfiction, seriously-great-writing, tales-from-around-the-world]",0802124550,9780802124555

It's no mean feat to match the horror of an experience with horrific language and not venture into fright-show territory.

While the love story moves quickly, the familiar feelings of alienation and loss that Clowes is known for remain long after the last panel. Beautiful and life-affirming colors provide an uncomfortable contrast to the story — and a freshness to Clowes' signature style.

Taking off from the 1st century work <em>The Satyricon,</em> he crams his pages with epic battles and agonized bodies. Blutch is celebrated in Europe, but this is only the second of his books to be translated into English.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, for-history-lovers, nonfiction, tales-from-around-the-world]",1590179838,9781590179833

""I remember when you wouldn't dare walk on the Bowery!"" Well, these are the real stories, kids, told by the people who were there, creating and destroying music, art and fashion at the nexus of what became New York punk.

Blurring the lines between realism and mysticism, DeConnick ruminates on life and death, heroism and the grisly violence of war by further unfurling the fantastical world inhabited by Sissy, the female embodiment of Death. Rendered in breathtaking abstraction by Ríos and gorgeously colored by Jordie Bellaire, <em>Pretty Deadly</em> is the kind of compelling and layered series that rewards multiple readings, if only so you can linger over every imaginative page.","[staff-picks, comics-and-graphic-novels, for-art-lovers, ladies-first, science-fiction-and-fantasy]",1632156946,9781632156945

In order to protect the dog, Ray is forced to leave his hometown, a journey that both frees him and destroys him.

That said, for American adults who have devoured Ferrante's <em>Neapolitan</em> quartet, it will be a pure and strange delight. It's a wispy and weird little tale that feels familiar — another Ferrante mother and daughter pair working through the complexity, cruelty and beauty of their bond.

If you're a woman questioning your life choices 1,000 times over, these essays will give you a sense of normalcy, with a few laughs and tears along the way.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, family-matters, funny-stuff, identity-and-culture, ladies-first, lets-talk-about-sex, nonfiction]",0062389513,9780062389510
Brian Copenhaver (editor),The Book Of Magic: From Antiquity To The Enlightenment,"If you're looking for an encyclopedia of tricks, <em>The Book of Magic</em> might not give you much, but if you're hoping to trace how magic has been defined and perceived, editor Brian Copenhaver has you covered. The Roman writer Pliny called magic ""The Most Fraudulent of the Arts""; many in the early Renaissance both believed and feared it. This collection, nearly 600 pages of increasingly interconnected extracts, provides some thoughtful insight and covers an impressive scope (rites in Fire Temples, how to make a golem, the usual) on a subject that keeps revealing new sides just like magic.","[eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, its-all-geek-to-me, nonfiction, rather-long]",0241198569,9780241198568
Esmé Weijun Wang,The Border Of Paradise: A Novel,"This singular debut from Esmé Weijun Wang has all the trappings of a classic gothic novel: half-siblings trapped in a decaying and isolated house, forbidden affection, suicide, a rapacious forest fire. But this family tragedy is more than just a sensational saga. Its dynamic, rotating points of view, exploration of identity and trauma, precise characterization and stunning prose make it a literary novel of the highest order.","[family-matters, identity-and-culture, realistic-fiction]",1939419697,9781939419699
Kate Tempest,The Bricks That Built The Houses,"The novel opens with a young trio tearing away from London with an ill-gotten suitcase of cash and violence on their heels. Think you know what's next? The novel that follows doesn't fit the script. It's full of crimes, but it's no thriller; imagine aimlessness, not a chase. It's a searing portrait of love, crushed dreams, youthful despair and stubborn longing in fast-gentrifying London. As a novel it's far from perfect, and the meandering plot drove me bonkers. But I didn't regret a minute I spent with the characters, drawn in agonizingly empathetic detail by a keen-eyed poet.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, ladies-first, love-stories, realistic-fiction, tales-from-around-the-world]",1620409011,9781620409015
Glen Weldon,The Caped Crusade: Batman And The Rise Of Nerd Culture,"""Batman is an inkblot; we see in him what we want to,"" writes Glen Weldon in <em>The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture.</em> It might as well be the book's mantra. His hilarious, incisive history of the Dark Knight focuses equally on the character, his creators and his hordes of diehard fans as they have all changed over the decades — for better and for worse. Under that iconic cowl, Weldon sees ugliness, wonder and the undercurrents of pop culture in all their conflicting glory.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, for-history-lovers, identity-and-culture, its-all-geek-to-me, nonfiction]",1476756694,9781476756691
Alison Goodman,The Dark Days Club,"Everyone who reads genre fiction is familiar with its habit of playing fast and loose with historical trappings: a romance set in the 19th century, but all that's really different is corsets; a swords and sorcery fantasy set in the Middle Ages, but all that's really different is no people of color or women with agency. It's rare — but thrilling — to find a book that takes both generic conventions and historical accuracy seriously, as Alison Goodman's delightful fantasy novel <em>The Dark Days Club</em> does. So if you're equally excited to read about well-bred young ladies slaying demons <em>and</em> the tiny jugs they carried underneath their gowns in case they needed to relieve themselves while awaiting a royal audience, look no further. This is the book for you.","[historical-fiction, love-stories, mysteries-and-thrillers, rather-long, science-fiction-and-fantasy, young-adult]",0670785474,9780670785476
Carolyn Phillips,"The Dim Sum Field Guide: A Taxonomy Of Dumplings, Buns, Meats, Sweets And Other Specialties Of The Chinese Teahouse","Small enough to fit in a handbag, Carolyn Phillips' beautifully illustrated guide really can help a nervous diner navigate the sometimes intimidating realm of dim sum. Phillips knows her stuff: She lived in Taiwan for eight years, married into a Chinese family and spent more than a decade as a Mandarin interpreter. This book evolved out of her work for the foodie magazine Lucky Peach, and is packed with lovingly scholarly details for novice and expert alike — everything from advice on what to dip your har gao into (mixture of mustard and soy sauce) to the Chinese name for Chinese beignets, which translates to ""white sugar sandy old men.""","[staff-picks, cookbooks-and-food, identity-and-culture, its-all-geek-to-me]",1607749564,9781607749561

Mark Z. Danielewski,"The Familiar, Volume 3: Honeysuckle & Pain","<em>The Familiar</em> is a massive, ambitious, flawed, brilliant and deeply weird endeavor projected to run through 27 volumes, all centering around a special (possibly magical) little girl named Xanther and a freaky (absolutely magical) stray cat. It has a sprawling cast of outlaws, computer programmers, drug dealers and mystics, is formatted and designed as maybe 53 percent art project (to 46 percent novel and 1 percent literary LSD), and will absolutely pop your gourd no matter where you drop into it. While Volume 3 is perhaps the most readable (and least plodding) of the growing set, what saves the entire series from being some kind of annoying pure-thought experimento-novel is the fact that Mark Z. Danielewski can write. He makes characters that are beautifully drawn, grounded and relatable even amid all the madness on the page.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, rather-long, science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing]",0375714987,9780375714986
Jesmyn Ward (editor),The Fire This Time: A New Generation Speaks About Race,"Written in 1963, James Baldwin's famed book of essays <em>The Fire Next Time</em> is actually a good fit for the social media age. In this similarly slim tribute <em>The Fire This Time,</em> editor and writer Jesmyn Ward honors Baldwin's legacy with writers who, as rapper Biggie Smalls would have said, if you don't know — now you know: Rachel Kaadzi Ghansah, Kiese Laymon, Daniel José Older, Claudia Rankine and many more poets and novelists.

Joe Hill,The Fireman,"Even though Joe Hill launched his writing career as a fully formed, highly distinctive author, he still gets compared to his father, Stephen King. But those comparisons are inevitable, given the deliberate parallels both men draw to each other's work. In <em>The Fireman,</em> Hill makes a brilliant leap of imagination, creating a horrifying plague that causes victims to burst into flame. But he also illustrates the resulting apocalypse in ways that recall King's <em>The Stand,</em> from his worldwide focus to his deep look at richly realized characters, particularly an infected heroine trying to bring her pregnancy to term before she dies.","[ladies-first, rather-long, science-fiction-and-fantasy, the-dark-side]",0062200631,9780062200631
Peter Ho Davies,The Fortunes,"A beautifully constructed novel told in four disparate though loosely linked parts, <em>The Fortunes</em> tackles the experience of being Chinese in America. Peter Ho Davies writes with a rare emotional resonance and a deft sense of structure about four different people, in different periods of American history, grappling with the fact that they are seen as ""less than"" whites. This complex, rich novel asks what it means to be a person navigating the strands of identity, the things that made us who we are, whoever that is.","[historical-fiction, identity-and-culture, realistic-fiction, tales-from-around-the-world]",0544263707,9780544263703

Here, dreams become extensions of life — or life itself is a dream; they are cut from the same fabric, consistently lurid and terrifying.","[historical-fiction, ladies-first, tales-from-around-the-world]",0805093028,9780805093025
Siddhartha Mukherjee,The Gene: An Intimate History,"Siddhartha Mukherjee is a first-rate science writer, who makes even the trickiest bits of biology easy to understand. But <em>The Gene,</em> his disarming study of what's known and believed about inheritance, is really a story about people — about the way blind luck, missed opportunities and misguided ambition can win or lose the day in scientific research  and life. ""Science is an endurance sport,"" Mukherjee writes. Take, for example, Austrian monk Gregor Mendel, who planted his famous peas only after twice failing his exams to teach high school science. There is much humor and warmth in Mukherjee's book, but he also chronicles the devastating history of eugenics. For anyone eager to learn more about the real promise and limits of ""personalized medicine,"" to understand where we've been and where we're headed, <em>The Gene</em> is an insightful guide.","[staff-picks, eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, its-all-geek-to-me, nonfiction, rather-long, science]",1476733503,9781476733500
Heidi Heilig,The Girl From Everywhere,"Nix has spent her whole life sailing the seas with her father, who possesses the ability to transport his ship and crew to any time and place — as long as he has a map to use as a guide. They're on the hunt for one special map that will bring them home to Honolulu in 1868, where Nix's mother is about to die giving birth to her. But Nix is afraid that by helping her father save the woman he loves, she'll erase her own existence. This debut catapults delightfully from one map to the next, offering a fresh and captivating approach to time travel.","[family-matters, historical-fiction, science-fiction-and-fantasy, young-adult]",0062380753,9780062380753
Emma Cline,The Girls,"You may have heard that <em>The Girls</em> is a fictional version of the infamous Manson Family murders. Really it is more about the toxic mixture of neediness and naiveté that can lead a young girl into a terrible situation from which there is no return. Evie, an unhappy teenager, is adrift and aimless one summer when she becomes fascinated by Suzanne, the leader of a group of girls who live in a nearby commune. As an adult Evie looks back on that summer, she sees how close she came to being part of a brutal murder, and it becomes obvious that she has never fully recovered from it. This is a chilling story, made more compelling by Cline's ability to show us just how easily such a close encounter with evil can happen.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, ladies-first, lets-talk-about-sex, realistic-fiction, the-dark-side]",081299860X,9780812998603
Dava Sobel,The Glass Universe: How The Ladies Of The Harvard Observatory Took The Measure Of The Stars,"""Pickering's Harem"" — the women hired as assistants at the Harvard Observatory — have existed on the fringes as fleeting mentions in contemporary scientific publications, or tucked into the footnotes of astronomy texts. So Dava Sobel's <em>The Glass Universe</em> is a parallel discovery — of the women, and of the work. Her subjects are supernaturally intrepid; Sobel teases out their doubts, frustrations and triumphs. But the sky comes first, and the book's true passion is the staggering impact of their work and the struggle to have it recognized. Pickering's Harem shaped the way we organize the universe; <em>The Glass Universe</em> makes that discovery a joy.","[biography-and-memoir, eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, its-all-geek-to-me, ladies-first, nonfiction, science]",0670016950,9780670016952
Francis Ford Coppola,The Godfather Notebook,"When Francis Ford Coppola was preparing to shoot <em>The Godfather,</em> he took a razor blade to Mario Puzo's 1969 book, cut out every page and pasted them into a notebook. Then he scribbled in the margins and underlined important passages, while slashing others. For each section he planned to film, he included notes on synopsis, texture, tone and pitfalls to avoid. That 700-plus-page notebook has been made available for the first time in this reproduction, which includes an introduction by Coppola himself.

In this best-of collection, middle child Marlys braves a host of petty pubertal travails and fleeting moments of pure, ecstatic joy. Barry's genius lies in getting us to see — and feel — the world around her characters acutely as they do: Her sense-memory of childhood is vivid, and she expresses it with a deeply evocative, low-fi poetry.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, family-matters, for-art-lovers, funny-stuff, ladies-first, seriously-great-writing]",1770462643,9781770462649

Stop reading fake news stories on Facebook and enjoy this gorgeous meditation on what it means to stand by and what it means to stand up. The book takes place in post-World War II Switzerland, where the country is still figuring out what it meant to be neutral during the horror. Young Gustav is growing up in the shadow of his mother's anger, and his father's death — I don't want to say more — and he's learned to conceal and control himself to his detriment. That's until he meets Anton, a young Jewish boy who becomes his dearest friend.  There is a moment in this book toward the end where I sobbed quietly, wrote down a line, took stock of my life and continued reading.

Josh and Lucy are professional rivals from two recently merged publishing houses. They share an office. They are both determined to win a coveted promotion. And they <em>hate</em> each other.

Whether the story is about 12-year-old Lev, who is sent away to live with his emotionally distant aunt, or about the gaunt and enigmatic boy he encounters is up to the reader. As deep as it is dark, Eugene Yelchin's artwork illuminates his haunting ghost story built on abandonment, loss and love.

Donald Ray Pollock,The Heavenly Table: A Novel,"To compare <em>The Heavenly Table</em> to Cormac McCarthy's <em>Blood Meridian</em> is too simple. To set it against Sam Peckinpah's blood-and-thunder Western films is silly because Peckinpah was a product of his historical moment and Donald Ray Pollock seems to float, timeless, somewhere above all base considerations of chronology. What would be apt is to say that Pollock's ragged-edge Western about the grinding impact of progress on a varied cast of characters who are bewildered by onrushing modernity is what might've come from some kind of whiskey-and-Benzedrine-fueled weekend in a mountain cabin, with McCarthy and Peckinpah passing a notebook back and forth, trying to outdo the other with madness, bloodshed and genius.

Yann Martel,The High Mountains Of Portugal: A Novel,"If you loved Yann Martel's Booker Prize-winning novel, <em>Life of Pi,</em> his newest novel offers some familiar pleasures. Like its blockbuster predecessor, <em>The High Mountains of Portugal</em> explores themes of faith, loss and what it means to be home. This book also has a charismatic animal at its center — this time a chimpanzee, not a Bengal tiger. Despite those similarities, <em>The High Mountains of Portugal</em> feels new. It tells three connected stories spanning a century, all converging on the oddly named location of the title. There are no literal mountains in this corner of Portugal, but Martel's characters still manage to find, in this landscape, a path to ascend.","[staff-picks, historical-fiction, seriously-great-writing, tales-from-around-the-world]",0812997174,9780812997170
Catherine Banner,The House At The Edge Of Night: A Novel,"<em>The House at the Edge of Night</em> is a misty Mediterranean dream of a book. It's so simple that there is only room for the emotions found in children's tales: sad, glad, hopeful, lonely. Women are beautiful, men are tall, the air smells of bougainvillea. Like good fictional Mediterraneans, they eat ricotta, drink limoncello and dance in the piazza. This exquisite and unabashed fulfillment of tropes is — when done as well as it is here — deeply satisfying, like a familiar recipe perfectly executed.","[book-club-ideas, family-matters, love-stories, realistic-fiction]",0812998790,9780812998795

Her evocative new memoir, <em>The Latter Days,</em> also focuses on the mysteries of a marriage: her own. Freeman was raised a Mormon in Utah. In the mid-1960s, at the age of 17, she married her sister's former boyfriend and became a mother to an infant with severe heart problems. <em>The Latter Days</em> candidly dramatizes Freeman's struggle to imagine other possibilities for herself beyond the ones Mormonism dictated to her.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, book-club-ideas, family-matters, identity-and-culture, ladies-first, nonfiction]",0307908615,9780307908612

She arrives in London — alive with ""traffic all gadding in the midday shine"" and ""pigeons at infernal coo"" — to audition for drama school. Eily's live, wriggling words construe themselves without the pens of grammar. She often inverts the verb and subject (walk I) which gives a kind of precarious immediacy to her sentences, like grammar can't stand up straight under the weight of the narrator's wild wants.

It's the story of Faith Sunderly, her naturalist father's mysterious murder and the magical tree that grows truth-revealing fruits only when Faith whispers lies to it. This book feels destined to be read in the middle of a dark and stormy night, preferably under the covers and with a secret flashlight.

It reminds me of an invention of my little brother's called ""poogle cake,"" which was made by combining every ingredient in the refrigerator — savory, sweet, expired, all — and baking it for 20 minutes.

It's hard to say more than this about the book — which delivers lines that you'll want to savor and read out loud — because it's a story about secrets and betrayals, and part of the pleasure is your own sighs and gasps. It's both intimate and epic in scope. The mothers of the novel's title are a kind of Greek chorus — the ""mothers"" of the church community — but the book is really about being motherless.

But when the mother who abandoned him as a child suddenly reappears on every TV screen in America as a viral sensation, throwing rocks at a conservative politician, he is given a chance to write a book about her in which he must savage his own mother in lurid, tell-all fashion. It's a job he takes, of course. Because he's furious. And desperate. Nathan Hill's digressive, scattershot exploration of the boy, the man, his mother and the times that shaped them is a brilliant, heartbreaking glimpse into just one of the casualties that time and memory make of us all.","[family-matters, rather-long, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing]",110194661X,9781101946619
N.K. Jemisin,The Obelisk Gate,"This worthy sequel to last year's magnificent <em>The Fifth Season</em> goes underground, as earth-magician Essun and her companions settle cautiously into life in a strange, crystalline community called Castrima. There Essun has to learn everything she can from Alabaster, her former mentor, before he dies (using magical obelisks to break the world in order to heal it has taken its toll, and his body is slowly turning to stone). Meanwhile, Essun's lost daughter, Nassun, is far away receiving her own magical education — and being sharpened into a weapon against her mother. <em>The Obelisk Gate</em> is a lightning rod around which storm clouds gather to burst and strike in the trilogy's final book next year.","[book-club-ideas, ladies-first, science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing]",0316229261,9780316229265
Isabel Greenberg,The One Hundred Nights Of Hero: A Graphic Novel,"You don't have to have read Isabel Greenberg's 2013 wry, fabulist love story <em>An Encyclopedia of Early Earth</em> to make sense of this similarly folktale-inflected tale of smart, flinty women slyly triumphing over boorish, violent men. But it's set in the same mythical universe, and the two books are animated by the same funny, matter-of-factly feminist sensibility. This sardonic spin on <em>The 1,001 Nights</em> simultaneously deconstructs and celebrates the power of storytelling.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, for-art-lovers, funny-stuff, ladies-first]",0316259179,9780316259170
Ben Lindbergh and Sam Miller,The Only Rule Is It Has To Work: Our Wild Experiment Building A New Kind of Baseball Team,"It's fair to say that every baseball fan ever has grumbled over their team's strategy, but in this era of advanced statistics, that second-guessing has given way to a new type of data-minded armchair analyst who might actually be able to do the job. So when Ben Lindbergh and Sam Miller — two sabermetrically inclined writers — were handed the keys to the small-town Sonoma Stompers for a summer season, they had free rein to finally put their wildest ideas to the test. The resulting book certainly goes deep in the weeds, er, outfield grass of implementing high-concept, stat-driven theories. But it's an idiosyncratic, compelling character study of the writers and their management challenges, and the journeymen players you can't help but root for.","[staff-picks, its-all-geek-to-me, nonfiction]",1476978374,9781476978376
Il Sung Na,The Opposite Zoo,"A zoo closes down for a night, but not before a monkey sneaks out of his cage. He's off to discover opposites! This picture book is so spacious — often with just one word per page — that kids can take in each and every drawing. The book is an invitation: <em>Come in, observe.</em> Watch the soft tiger reach toward the prickly hedgehog. See the wide-awake owl and the sleeping panda. After reading this book, kids will set off to find opposites in their own environments. (And, don't worry, the monkey gets back in his cage before the zoo opens the next morning!)

Andrés Reséndez,The Other Slavery: The Uncovered Story Of Indian Enslavement In America,"The history of the enslavement of people from North America and the Caribbean is deliberately murky; those who practiced it often did so in places where slavery was technically illegal and went to some trouble to invent legal loopholes for it. Andrés Reséndez keeps a deliberate, scholarly distance from the material, bringing forth evidence and constructing careful — even conservative — arguments. But that evidence speaks for itself, and the horrors quietly pile up. In a country that still denies a Native American genocide ever took place, <em>The Other Slavery</em> is a necessary work.","[eye-opening-reads, for-history-lovers, nonfiction, the-dark-side]",0547640986,9780547640983

In ""State Change,"" a woman's soul is an ice cube she must keep from melting; in ""All the Flavors,"" a child in 1870s Idaho meets the red-faced god of war and listens to his stories. The final story — appropriately named ""The Man Who Ended History: A Documentary"" — is a harrowing meditation on nations, memory, responsibility and to whom the past can rightly be said to belong.

Lee Eisenberg,"The Point Is: Making Sense Of Birth, Death, And Everything In Between","""Our stories are us,"" writes former <em>Esquire</em> editor-in-chief Lee Eisenberg. Maybe that's a point of view especially appealing to journalists; it certainly grabbed me. His book ventures into great thinkers' territory, but there's nothing stuffy here. It's engaging as can be, and as much about the importance of memory and the stories we choose to tell about ourselves as it is about the point of our existence. The two go hand in hand: Creating and framing our life stories gives our lives meaning. For Eisenberg, the story is the point. And reading his is a pleasure.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, nonfiction]",1455550469,9781455550463
Elizabeth McKenzie,The Portable Veblen: A Novel,"Elizabeth McKenzie's quirky romantic comedy is a frisky charmer about a brainy, off-center couple who face up to their differences – and their difficult, eccentric families – only after they become engaged. In a nutshell, she – named for the Norwegian American economist and social critic Thorstein Veblen — values life's simpler offerings, including the friendship of a squirrel who's taken up residence in her attic. He's an ambitious neurologist tempted by the spoils of his potentially lucrative life-saving invention. The novel is ultimately a morality tale about the values by which we choose to live, but it's deliciously madcap and whimsical.","[funny-stuff, love-stories, realistic-fiction]",1594206856,9781594206856

But when she gets the role that could make her immortal, a true doyenne of the Paris opera, she realizes that the libretto is based on a secret from her past. The search for the person who betrayed her transports readers to an American farm, a traveling circus, a French brothel and an opera stage, a journey made entirely possible because of Lilliet's voice — her singing voice as well as her narrative voice, both of which are captured beautifully in this book.","[for-music-lovers, historical-fiction, ladies-first, rather-long]",0618663029,9780618663026

What follows is Nelson's account of the trial and her own fascination with the murder. Nelson's resistance to the easy answer, her willingness to reach a kind of conclusion and then to break it, to probe further and further, to ask about her own complex and not entirely noble intentions instead of facilely condemning others, make <em>The Red Parts</em> an uneasy masterpiece.","[biography-and-memoir, book-club-ideas, family-matters, ladies-first, nonfiction, seriously-great-writing, the-dark-side]",1555977367,9781555977368

The menu, as featured in <em>The Red Rooster Cookbook,</em> showcases a heady fusion of Southern and global influences: fried chicken marinated in coconut milk; collard greens with spiced butter; grits made with white miso. And the book itself is a kind of scrapbook, filled with not just food but photographs, stories and the chef's own playlists — a pulsing melange of blues, R&B, jazz and hip-hop.","[cookbooks-and-food, for-music-lovers, identity-and-culture]",0544639774,9780544639775

Nick doesn't know why he has been released decades early, but he knows that a crime kingpin named Darius Cole — who is still inside the prison — is responsible. The limo takes Nick to Darius' townhouse, and the driver leaves him with ominous advice: ""This isn't freedom. This is <em>mobility.</em> Don't get those two things confused."" Soon, Nick's cellphone begins ringing with grisly assignments from Darius, spurring Nick to plot his escape. <em>The Second Life of Nick Mason</em> is so good, it stands shoulder to paranoid shoulder with the classics of the noir genre.","[staff-picks, mysteries-and-thrillers, the-dark-side]",0399574328,9780399574320

With both compassionate clarity and slick, skeptical reportage, essayist Kristen Dombek reflects on how and why narcissism has become a toxic cultural obsession. As both narrator and case study, Dombek pauses often to check her own reflection in Narcissus' pool, complicating the idea that we can reassure ourselves about who we are by first determining who we are not.","[staff-picks, nonfiction, rather-short]",0865478236,9780865478237

He does it all with the humblest of materials, primarily papier-mâché and air-drying clay.","[eye-opening-reads, for-art-lovers, science-fiction-and-fantasy, tales-from-around-the-world]",0545946123,9780545946124

In the 21st century, Henry Forge and his daughter, Henrietta, set their hopes on an almost perfect filly named Hellsmouth.

Tana French,The Trespasser: A Novel,"If you're familiar with Tana French's mysteries, I can probably just stop here and tell you her new one is called <em>The Trespasser,</em> so you can hop off the Internet and go buy it. Such are the pleasures of French's books, a series of crime novels about the Dublin Murder Squad that require the reader to disappear into them immediately upon acquisition. If you've never read them, I'm jealous. Each book in the series is narrated by a different detective from the squad, which skews the perspective in a delicious way. This one is about Antoinette Conway, who is solving a murder with her partner Stephen Moran (he narrated the last book).

Sunjeev Sahota humanizes harrowing news headlines in the most intimate way; stories about migrant workers and so-called ""Untouchables"" are carefully captured with painterly details and empathy. The characters — three Indian men and a British-Indian woman they meet as they emigrate from India to England — lodged in my brain and stayed there, months after I put this book down to engage with others that I soon forgot. This book is best for a particular kind of reader who can withstand unrelentingly grim portrayals of the challenges its characters confront. It's not an easy read, intellectually or emotionally, but it's an important story about duty and love, beautifully told. Do not expect this author to spoon-feed you. The first page will likely contain words that are not in your vocabulary. My advice, just keep reading …","[staff-picks, eye-opening-reads, family-matters, identity-and-culture, rather-long, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing, tales-from-around-the-world, the-dark-side]",1101946105,9781101946107
Paul Goldberg,The Yid,"Paul Goldberg's audacious first novel begins after midnight on Feb. 24, 1953, when a state security officer and two soldiers in a Black Maria — a car used to transport prisoners through the night — attempt to arrest a Red Army veteran and onetime Moscow State Jewish Theater actor named Solomon Shimonovich Levinson. When they arrive, Levinson performs for them as if in a vaudeville skit, first baffling his antagonists, then killing all three in a theatrical stunt he calls a ""pirouette with smallswords,"" before gathering an ""ensemble of actors"" and setting off in the Black Maria on a journey to assassinate Stalin. Goldberg, a Russian emigre to the U.S. in 1973 whose parents' names were on Stalin's lists, draws upon historic fact in this tragicomic tour de force.","[historical-fiction, tales-from-around-the-world, the-dark-side]",1250079039,9781250079039
Brendan Wenzel,They All Saw A Cat,"""Walk a mile in someone else's shoes"" is a tough lesson to get across to the under 7 set; they're fairly certain they are the center of the universe. But Brendan Wenzel's stunning picture book stealthily embraces that theme with a sense of secret and wonder. As a brown tabby moves through the world on soft paws, readers see the cat through the eyes of other characters: a boy sees a pet, a fox sees a meal, a flea sees a forest of fur, and a mouse sees a terrifying monster — but they <em>all</em> see a cat. This simple, satisfying book was a great jumping-off point for discussions with my kids about how we all perceive the world in different ways.

Cathleen Schine,"They May Not Mean To, But They Do: A Novel","Cathleen Schine's charming novel takes a wise, witty look at a potentially unfunny subject: the upset that occurs when the seesaw of care tilts from elderly parents to their grown offspring. Recently widowed 86-year-old Joy Bergman is exhausted, bereft and ""hanging on by a bourgeois thread"" after the grueling death of her husband from Alzheimer's. Clinging to her independence, she strives to reassure her well-meaning children that she's OK. The novel plays the situation – a fridge filled with what look like petri dishes; a suitor who alarms Joy's family even more than the piles of unpaid bills — for a combination of mirth and pathos. But it's Schine's sensitivity to the losses and fears of both generations that really hits home.","[book-club-ideas, family-matters, funny-stuff, realistic-fiction]",0374280134,9780374280130
Simon Stålenhag,Things From The Flood,"Last year, Simon Stalenhag's beautiful art book, <em>Tales from the Loop</em>, gave us a peek into the alternate history of a small town in Sweden full of snow, distantly glowing lights and giant robots. This year, we have <em>Things from the Flood</em> — a darker sequel to that mind-blowing first visit to the Swedish suburbs where time, space and memory were altered by ""The Loop."" If anything, this second installment is even more affecting, offering a more complete narrative backbone, and a vision of the machine-haunted world that came after the collapse of The Loop. No one who spends any time traveling in Stalenhag's universe comes out the same on the other side. The words will mess with your head, but the illustrations (of the rusted shells of robots, floppy disks, suburban tract housing and portable stereos bubbling with horrible life) will climb right inside you and screw with your dreams.","[comics-and-graphic-novels, science-fiction-and-fantasy, the-dark-side]",1624650465,9781624650468
China Miéville,This Census-Taker,"<em>This Census-Taker</em> is the book you read when you're looking for something that will haunt your dreams for weeks (or months) after you put it down. It is a grown-up fairy tale with a black and murderous heart, about a boy convinced that his father is a murderer. One of China Miéville's greatest strengths is his ability to see his imaginary worlds through the eyes of his characters, not of his readers. The boy is young. He understands things as a child does — which is to say not really at all. But his is the only voice we have to hold to in a broken world filled with decaying machines, feral orphan children and war. This is Miéville at his most sparse, his most controlled and restrained.","[family-matters, mysteries-and-thrillers, science-fiction-and-fantasy, the-dark-side]",1101967323,9781101967324
Stephen O'Connor,Thomas Jefferson Dreams Of Sally Hemings: A Novel,"Everyone knows the story — or thinks they do — of Thomas Jefferson and his enslaved paramour, Sally Hemings. Stephen O'Connor gives us a vision of how that relationship began (yes, in sexual assault) and, given the obvious inequities in the relationship, grew into something approaching a meeting of minds. His Sally is sharply astute, and sees Jefferson more clearly than he sees himself. Makes you wonder what their relationship would have been like if they'd met today.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, family-matters, for-history-lovers, historical-fiction, rather-long]",0525429964,9780525429968
"Sherman Alexie, illustrated by Yuyi Morales",Thunder Boy Jr.,"Thunder Boy Smith Jr. loves his dad but hates having the same name. Or, rather, he hates that since people call his father ""Big Thunder,"" they call him ""Little Thunder."" He doesn't want to be a little anything, ""like a burp or a fart."" Brought to life with Yuyi Morales' warm, energetic illustrations, Sherman Alexie's picture book is refreshingly contemporary, radiant with emotion and packed with humor. It's a loving and empowered story of a young Native American boy of today. (A note for parents: If this book inspires your child to play with Native American naming traditions, you may want to talk with them about why that can be offensive. <a href=""https://americanindiansinchildrensliterature.blogspot.com/2016/05/how-to-read-sherman-alexies-thunder-boy.html"" target=""_blank"">There's more about that issue here.</a>) (For ages 2 to 5)","[funny-stuff, identity-and-culture, kids-books]",0316013722,9780316013727
Maria Semple,Today Will Be Different,"If you loved <em>Where'd You Go, Bernadette,</em> let's be friends! Also, look, a new Maria Semple novel! You'll enjoy this one in a single day, which is significant since the book's action takes place in a 24-hour period. It reads fast and you'll laugh aplenty alongside its difficult heroine, whom the author draws so sharply you'll wince. Eleanor Flood is a beleaguered TV writer with a husband and son — and her life is spinning out of control.  She begins the day with the mantra of the title, which I think we can all recognize: Who hasn't made promises to live life differently and do more yoga, only to give it all up by breakfast?  Eleanor's day, of course, goes haywire, and while it has some good old-fashioned laughs, it's also serious about its message of reinvention, and forgiveness.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, family-matters, funny-stuff, ladies-first, realistic-fiction]",0316403431,9780316403436
Bob Mehr,Trouble Boys: The True Story Of The Replacements,"In a tome the size of a hardcover Bible, Bob Mehr charts the births, deaths and small resurrections of Minneapolitan rock icons The Replacements. It is the sort of music journalism that reminds you why people bother with music journalism in the first place: Mehr gives us tales of granite-jawed, precocious boys getting drunk, commercially successful and self-destructive through voluminous reportage with seemingly everyone who ever crossed their path.  

For a band that attracts a cultish level of adoration, this is a welcome quality. Mehr fortifies the book against the typical melodrama of the music biography with a willingness to be fully absent from the work. Objectively, thoroughly and tragically, he shows us trouble.","[staff-picks, biography-and-memoir, for-music-lovers, nonfiction]",0306818795,9780306818790
"Laia Jufresa, translated by Sophie Hughes",Umami,"<em>Umami</em> is a debut novel that I am afraid has been criminally under-read, a slim book about community and loss that somehow doesn't feel as heavy as it could.  Told from multiple perspectives within a building complex in Mexico City, it feels as if the early chapters are short stories with little in common, but Laia Jufresa magically layers them on top of each other, illuminating the secret sorrows that connect them all.  It's beautifully translated by Sophie Hughes, a tall order because of the different kinds of language all of the characters use. In the end, <em>Umami</em> isn't resolved in the ways a traditional novel would be — but it's satisfying and moving.","[staff-picks, family-matters, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing, tales-from-around-the-world]",1780748914,9781780748917
Ben H. Winters,Underground Airlines,"<p>Ben Winters' work of alternate history imagines the Civil War never happened. Instead, Abraham Lincoln was assassinated before he took office and, in an act of compromise, four states were allowed to maintain slavery. The other states all agreed that any escaped ""Persons Bound to Labor"" must be returned to their corporate plantation. That's where Victor comes in: He's a bounty hunter who's adept at his job because he's black. </p>

<p>The world Winters conjures up is chillingly credible. As a white author, he has imagined himself into the consciousness of Victor. These days, that's a controversial move, but the exceptional novel that results seems justification enough for this act of creative crossing. </p>","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, mysteries-and-thrillers]",0316261246,9780316261241

But <em>Urban Forests</em> makes you stop and pay attention to the ""living landmarks"" standing tall in America's cities. From Thomas Jefferson's time to present day, Jill Jonnes explores the essential roles trees play in urban centers — filtering air, providing habitat, offering shade, calming nerves and more.  I loved this book because it's both for history lovers and for tree devotees.

It takes place in a recognizable near-future; our experiments are its reality. Rebecca Wright is married to a physicist who is endeavoring to create a ""causality violation device.""

Rebecca's growing unease with the world around her clearly relates to that device, those self-driving cars and the Wrights' strange yet lovely son — but I'll let you find out the rest.","[staff-picks, rather-long, science-fiction-and-fantasy, seriously-great-writing]",0307907597,9780307907592
"Tom King, illustrated by Gabriel Hernandez Walta",Vision Volume 1: Little Worse Than A Man,"Writer Tom King has taken the Marvel Universe's resident robot-with-a-heart-of-gold and crafted a smart, funny, deeply emotional and slyly trenchant examination of the all-too-human need to fit in. In the series, the Vision constructs a happy suburban family for himself and moves to suburban Arlington, Va., where their presence stokes bigotry and fear. Gabriel Hernandez Walta's deceptively simple art pivots deftly with the book's tonal transitions from light comedy to heart-wrenching tragedy.

When Beatriz Yagoda, a famously unpredictable, cigar-smoking, 60-something Brazilian writer goes missing, her devoted young American translator drops everything — including a suffocatingly dull boyfriend — to fly down to Rio to search for her. In the process, the young woman finds adventure, danger, unexpected love, long-buried secrets, and lessons about both the importance of close reading and what makes a satisfying life.","[family-matters, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing, tales-from-around-the-world]",0316298492,9780316298490

Garth Greenwell's devastatingly beautiful novel about a gay American expat in Bulgaria and his on-again, off-again relationship with a sex worker named Mitko has been one of the year's breakout hits, and for good reason. It's a virtuosic, tender exploration of loneliness and desire, with sentences so breathtaking you'll find yourself returning to them over and over again.","[identity-and-culture, lets-talk-about-sex, love-stories, realistic-fiction, seriously-great-writing, tales-from-around-the-world]",1250117895,9781250117892

Wilson is uncommonly self-aware as she reflects on losing her mother to cancer, no longer passing as ""cute"" in Hollywood and learning to let go of — and thank — the iconic character of Matilda.

Gus' son dies, his marriage falls apart and he finds numbness — and a job — at the Paragon Hotel on New York's Long Island. But it isn't long before Gus gets drawn into solving a murder.

In her brilliant new book <em>White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America,</em> Nancy Isenberg shatters the illusion that, at least if you were white and male, you could achieve whatever you wanted in this vast new land of opportunity. Instead, Isenberg introduces us to the ""lubbers,"" the ""clay-eaters,"" the ""crackers"" — all the marginalized people who were shipped off to the Colonies, ""simply to throw down manure and die in a vacuous muck.""

But when reviewers draw a parallel between <em>Mockingbird</em> and Lauren Wolk's <em>Wolf Hollow,</em> they are being neither hyperbolic, nor lazy.

Don DeLillo,Zero K,"First, a word of warning: I'm biased. As a longtime evangelist for Don DeLillo's novels, I brought to <em>Zero K</em> some baked-in affection for its author — but also the lurking fear that the long-awaited novel wouldn't meet my expectations. Happily, those fears were misplaced, and then soon replaced by others of DeLillo's own making. This novel is an eerie descent into a secret collective that seeks to elude death through cryonic freezing. It blends DeLillo's typical mix of introspection and creeping dread with something else — a menacing sense of the absurd, borrowed from Kafka. Combine this with a wry sense of humor and you've got a dive into the murky boundary between life and death that's as amusing as it is alarming.","[staff-picks, book-club-ideas, seriously-great-writing]",1501135392,9781501135392
